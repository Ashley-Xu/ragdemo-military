31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 iii Preface 
ADP 3-0, Operations , constitutes the Army â€™s view of how to conduct prompt and sustained operations across  
multiple domains, and it sets the foundation for developing othe r principles, tactics, techniques, and 
procedures detailed in subordinate doctrine publications. It ar ticulates the Army â€™s operational doctrine for 
unified land operations. ADP 3-0 accounts for the uncertainty o f operations and recognizes that a military 
operation is a human undertaking. Additionally, this publicatio n is the foundation for training and Army 
education system curricula related to unified land operations.
The principal audience for ADP 3-0 is all members of the profes sion of arms. Commanders and staffs of 
Army headquarters serving as joint task force (JTF) or multinat ional headquarters should also refer to 
applicable joint or multinational doctrine concerning the range  of military operations and joint or 
multinational forces. Trainers and educators throughout the Arm y will use this publication as well.  
Commanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure that their decision s and actions comply with applicable United 
States, international, and in some cases host-nation laws and r egulations. Commanders at all levels ensure 
that their Service members operate in accordance with the law o f war and the rules of engagement. (See 
FM 27-10.) 
ADP 3-0 uses joint terms where applicable. Selected joint and A rmy terms and definitions appear in both the 
glossary and the text. Terms for which ADP 3-0 is the proponent  publication (the authority) are marked with 
an asterisk (*) in the glossary. Definitions for which ADP 3-0 is the proponent publication are boldfaced in 
the text. For other definitions shown in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent 
publication follows the definition. 
ADP 3-0 applies to the Active Army, Army National Guard/Army Na tional Guard of the United States, and 
United States Army Reserve unless otherwise stated.  
The proponent of ADP 3-0 is the United States Army Combined Arm s Center. The preparing agency is the 
Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate, United States Army Combined  Arms Center. Send comments and

31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 v Introduction 
ADP 3-0 describes how the Army conducts operations as a unified  action partner using the Army â€™s
operational concept â€”a fundamental statement that frames how Army forces, operating as part of a joint 
force, conduct operations (ADP 1-01). The Army â€™s operational concept is unified land operations. ADP 3-0
discusses the foundations, tenets, and doctrine of unified land  operations, which serves as a common 
reference for solving military problems in multiple domains and  the framework for the range of military 
operations across the competition continuum. It is the core of Army doctrine, and it guides how Army forces 
contribute to unified action. (See the introductory figure on p age vi for the ADP 3-0 logic chart.) 
ADP 3-0 lists key ideas, such as principles and tenets, as a me ans of organizing ways to think about military 
problem solving. A narrative discussion follows each list to pr ovide explanation and context about the 
subject. The proper application of principles and tenets to a p articular situation requires situational 
understanding informed by professional judgment. Like all doctr ine, ADP 3-0 provides a common approach 
to problem solving, not a list of  solutions that can substitute  for thinking by commanders and staffs.  
ADP 3-0 modifies key topics and updates terminology and concept s as necessary. These topics include the 
discussion of an operational environment and the operational an d mission variables, as well as discussions 
of unified action, law of land warfare, and combat power. ADP 3 -0 maintains combined arms as the 
application of arms that multiplies Army forces â€™ effectiveness in all operations. However, it expands 
combined arms to include joint and multinational capabilities a s integral to combined arms and discusses 
how the Army conducts these operations across multiple domains.  (For more detailed information on specific 
tactics and procedures, see FM 3-0.) 
ADP 3-0 contains five chapters and one appendix: 
Chapter 1  defines military operations, in context, for the Army. It desc ribes the variables that shape the 
nature of an operational environment and affect outcomes. It pr ovides explanation of unified action and joint 
operations as well as land operations and the Army â€™s four strategic roles. Finally, it discusses the importance 
of training to gain skill in land warfare.  
Chapter 2  is a discussion on the application of operational art. It deta ils how commanders should consider 
defeat and stability mechanisms when developing an operational approach. It presents the elements of 
operational art and describes their meaning.  
Chapter 3  a d d r e s s e s  t h e  A r m y â€™s operational concept of unified  land operations. It describes how 
commanders will likely apply landpower as part of unified actio n to defeat enemy forces on land and establish 
conditions that accomplish the joint force commander â€™s(JFCâ€™s) objectives. Chapter 3 defines the principles 
and tenets of unified land operations.
Chapter 4  provides the operations structure commanders use to array forc es and conduct operations. It also 
includes the operational framework used in the conduct of unifi ed land operations.
Chapter 5  defines combat power. It discusses the elements of combat powe r and describes the six 
warfighting functions used to generate combat power. Lastly, it  discusses how Army forces organize combat 
power through force tailoring, task organization, and mutual su pport.  
Appendix A  addresses command and support relationships. It describes thes e as the basis for unity of 
command and unity of effort in operations. It details how comma nd relationships and authorities affect Army 
force generation, force tailoring, and task organization. It fu rther discusses how commanders use Army 
support relationships when task-organizing Army forces.

Military Operations 
This chapter discusses military operations, their relationship to operational 
environments, and the threats that exist within them. The chapt er then discusses the 
Armyâ€™s strategic roles in the context of unified action and joi nt operations. Lastly, this 
chapter discusses land operations and training readiness.
AN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 
1-1. An operational environment  is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influence s that affect
the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the  commander (JP 3-0). Commanders at all
levels have their own operational environments for their partic ular operations. An operational environment
for any specific operation comprises more than the interacting variables that exist within a specific physical
area. It also involves interconnected influences from the globa l or regional perspective (for example, politics
and economics) that impact on conditions and operations there. Thus, each commander â€™s operational
environment is part of a higher echelon commander â€™s operational environment.
1-2. Operational environments include considerations at the stra tegic, operational, and tactical levels of
warfare. At the strategic level, leaders develop an idea or set  of ideas for employing the instruments of
national power (diplomatic, informational, military, and econom ic) in a synchronized and integrated fashion
to accomplish national objectives. The operational level links the tactical employment of forces to national
and military strategic objectives, with the focus being on the design, planning, and conduct of operations
using operational art. (See chap ter 2 for a discussion of opera tional art.) The tactical level of warfare involves
the employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to  each other. The levels of warfare help
commanders visualize a logical arrangement of forces, allocate resources, and assign tasks based on a
strategic purpose, informed by t he conditions within their oper ational environments.
1-3. Broad trends such as glo balization, urbanization, technolog ical advances, and failing states affect land
operations. These trends can create instability and contribute to an environment of persistent competition and
conflict. Persistent conflict is the protracted confrontation a mong state, nonstate, and individual actors willing
to use violence to achieve politi cal and ideological ends. In s uch an operational environment, commanders
must seek and exploit opportunities for success. To exploit opp ortunities, commanders must thoroughly
understand the dynamic nature of their operational environment.  Previous experience within a similar
operational environment is not e nough to guarantee future missi on success in the current one.
1-4. Threats seek to employ capabilities to create effects in mu ltiple domains and the information
environment to counter U.S. interests and impede friendly opera tions. Their activities in the information
environment, space, an d cyberspace attempt to influence U.S. de cision makers and disrupt friendly
deployment of forces. Land-based threats will attempt to impede  joint force freedom of action across the air,
land, maritime, space, and cyber space domains. They will disrup t the electromagnetic spectrum, sow
confusion in the information environment, and challenge the leg itimacy of U.S. actions. Understanding how
threats can present multiple dilemmas to Army forces in all dom ains helps Army commanders identify (or
create), seize, and exploit their own opportunities.
1-5. Some peer threats have nuclear and chemical weapons capabil ities and the ability to employ such
weapons in certain situations. However, capability does not alw ays equal intent to use, and it is generally
presumed that most would use restraint. Preparation and plannin g that takes nuclear and chemical weapons
capabilities into account is of paramount importance in any con frontation with an adversary armed with them.
Understanding threat nuclear an d chemical weapons doctrine is i mportant, particularly during large-scale
ground combat operations.
Chapter 1 
1-2 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 1-6. Nuclear terrorism remains a threat to the United States and  to international security and stability.
Preventing the illicit acquisition of a nuclear weapon, nuclear  materials, or related technology and expertise
by a violent extremist organization is a significant U.S. natio nal security priority. The more states â€”
particularly rogue states â€”that possess nuclear weapons or the materials, technology, and knowledge required
to make them, the greater the potential risk of terrorist acqui sition. Given the nature of terrorist ideologies,
commanders and staffs must assume that terrorists would employ a nuclear weapon were they to acquire one.
1-7. Large-scale ground combat operations can occur below the nu clear threshold, and they are not
synonymous with total war. Large-scale ground combat operations  are sustained combat operations
involving multiple corps and divisions.  Planning for large-scale ground combat operations against enem ies
possessing nuclear weapons must account for the possibility of their use against friendly forces. The
operational approaches employed by joint force commanders (JFCs ) may thus be constrained to avoid nuclear
escalation in terms of their geographic depth and the assigned objectives. Large-scale ground combat
operations, while potentially enorm ous in scale and scope, are typically limited by the law of war and the
political objectives of the conflict itself. Against nuclear ar med enemies, the political objectives of a conflict
are also informed by the strategic risk inherent in escalation.  While the scale and scope of conventional
conflict has been smaller than World War II since 1945, it reta ins its inherent lethality and complexity.
1-8.  Successful operations against nuclear and chemically capab le peer threats require units prepared to
react to the employment of thos e capabilities and operate degra ded in contaminated environments. Planning
and training must include active and passive measures for prote ction against the effects of these weapons, as
well as techniques for mitigating their effects to preserve com bat power. This includes greater emphasis on
dispersion, survivability, and regenerating communications betw een echelons. These requirements must be
incorporated into every facet of doctrine and training, so unit s and commanders are technically and
psychologically prepared for the environment they may encounter . Survivability in this environment should
be a training and readiness objective.
1-9. Modern information technology makes the information environ ment, which includes cyberspace and
the electromagnetic spectrum, indi spensable to military operati ons. The information environment  i s  t h e
aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that colle ct, process, disseminate, or act on information
(JP 3-13). It is a key part of any operational environment, and  it will be simultaneously congested and
contested during operations. All actors in the information envi ronment â€”enemy, friendly, or neutral â€”remain
vulnerable to attack by physical, psychological, cyber, or elec tronic means. (See JP 3-12 for more information
on cyberspace operations and t he electromagnetic spectrum.)
1-10. No two operational environments are the same. An operation al environment consists of many
relationships and interactions among interrelated variables. Ho w entities and conditions interact within an
operational environment is often difficult to understand and re quires continuous analysis. (See paragraphs
1-13 through 1-15 for a discussio n of the operational and missio n variables.)
1-11. An operational environment continually evolves because of the complexity of human interaction and
how people learn and adapt. People â€™s actions change that environment. Some changes can be anticipa ted,
while others cannot. Some changes are immediate and apparent, w hile other changes evolve over time or are
extremely difficult to detect.
1-12. The complex and dynamic nature of an operational environme nt makes determining the relationship
between cause and effect difficult and contributes to the frict ion and uncertainty inherent in military
operations. Commanders must conti nually assess their operationa l environments and re-assess their
assumptions. Commanders and staffs use the Army design methodol ogy, operational variables, and mission
variables to analyze an operational environment to support the operations process. (See paragraphs 4-7
through 4-8 for a discussion of the Army design methodology.)
OPERATIONAL AND MISSION VARIABLES
1-13. An operational environment evolves as each operation progr esses. Army leaders use operational
variables to analyze and understand a specific operational envi ronment, and they use mission variables to
focus on specific elements during mission analysis. (See append ix A to FM 6-0 for a detailed discussion of
operational and mission variables.)
Military Operations 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 1-3 Operational Variables 
1-14.  Army planners describe conditions of an operational environment  in terms of operational variables. 
Operational variables are those a spects of an operational envir onment, both military and nonmilitary, that 
may differ from one operational area to another and affect oper ations. Operational variables describe not only 
the military aspects of an operational environment, but also th e population â€™s influence on it. Using Army 
design methodology, planners analyze an operational environment  in terms of eight interrelated operational 
variables: political, military, e conomic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time 
(known as PMESII-PT). As soon as a commander and staff have an indication of where their unit will conduct 
operations, they begin analyzing the operational variables asso ciated with that location. They continue to 
refine and update that analysis throughout the course of operat ions.  
Mission Variables 
1-15.  Upon receipt of an order, Army leaders filter information from operational variables into mission 
variables during mission analysis. They use the mission variabl es to refine their understanding of the 
situation. The mission variables consist of mission, enemy, ter rain and weather, troops and support available, 
time available, and civil consid erations (METT-TC). Incorporati ng the analysis of the operational variables 
with METT-TC ensures that Army leaders consider the best availa ble information about the mission.  
THREATS AND HAZARDS  
1-16.  For every operation, threats are  a fundamental part of an opera tional environment. A  threat  is any 
combination of actors, entities, or forces that have the capabi lity and intent to harm United States 
forces, United States national interests, or the homeland.  Threats may include individuals, organized or 
unorganized groups, paramilitary or military forces, nation-sta tes, or national alliances. Commanders and 
staffs must understand how current and potential threats organi ze, equip, train, employ, and control their 
forces. They must continually identify, monitor, and assess thr eats as they adapt and change over time.  
1-17.  In general, the various actors in  any operational area can qual ify as an enemy, an adversary, a neutral, 
or a friend. An  enemy  is a party identified as hostile against which the use of forc e is authorized . An 
enemy is also called a combatant  and is treated as such under t he law of war. Enemies will apply advanced 
technologies (such a cyberspace attack) as well as simple and d ual-use technologies (such as improvised 
explosive devices). Enemies avoi d U.S. strengths (such as long- range surveillance and precision strike 
missiles) through countermeasures (such as integrated air defen se systems, dispersion, concealment, and 
intermingling with civilian populations).  
1-18.  An adversary  is a party acknowledged as potentially hostile to a friendly p arty and against which the 
use of force may be envisaged (JP 3-0). During competition and conflict, a neutral is an identity applied to a 
party whose characteristics, beh avior, origin, or nationality i ndicate that it is neither supporting nor opposing 
friendly forces. Finally, a friend is a party that positively s upports U.S. efforts. Land operations often prove 
complex because enemies, adversaries, neutrals, and friends may  physically intermix, often with no easy 
means to distinguish one from another.  
1-19.  The term hybrid threat captures the complexity of operational e nvironments, the multiplicity of actors 
involved, and the blurring of traditionally regulated elements of conflict. A hybrid threat  is the diverse and 
dynamic combination of regular forces, irregular forces, terror ists, or criminal elements acting in 
concert to achieve mutually benefitting effects . Hybrid threats combine traditional forces governed by law, 
military tradition, and custom with unregulated forces that act  without constraints on the use of violence. 
These may involve nation-states using proxy forces or nonstate actors such as criminal and terrorist 
organizations that employ sophisticated capabilities traditiona lly associated with states. Hybrid threats are 
most effective when they exploit friendly constraints, capabili ty gaps, and lack of situational awareness.  
1-20.  A hazard  is a condition with the potential to cause injury, illness, or  death of personnel; damage to or 
loss of equipment or property; or mission degradation (JP 3-33) . Hazards include disease, extreme weather 
phenomena, solar flares, and ar eas contaminated by toxic materi als. Hazards can damage or destroy 
resources, reduce combat power, a nd contribute to early culmina tion that prevents mission accomplishment. 
Understanding hazards and their  effects on operations is genera lly done in the context of terrain, weather, 
and various other factors related to a particular mission.  
Chapter 1 
1-4 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 1-21. A peer threat is an adversary or enemy able to effectively  oppose U.S. forces world-wide while
enjoying a position of relative advantage in a specific region.  These threats can generate equal or temporarily
superior combat power in geographical proximity to a conflict a rea with U.S. forces. A peer threat may also
have a cultural affinity to specific regions, providing them re lative advantages in terms of time, space, and
sanctuary. They generate tactica l, operational, and strategic c hallenges an order of magnitude more
challenging militarily than  other adversaries.
1-22. Peer threats can employ resources across multiple domains to create lethal and nonlethal effects with
operational significance throughout an operational environment.  They seek to delay deployment of U.S.
forces and inflict significant damage across multiple domains i n a short period to achieve their goals before
culminating. A peer threat uses various methods to employ their  instruments of power to render U.S. military
power irrelevant. Five broad me thods, used in combination by pe er threats, include â€”
zInformation warfare.
zPreclusion.
zIsolation.
zSanctuary.
zSystems warfare.
1-23. Enemies and adversaries pursue anti-access and area-denial  capabilities, putting U.S. power projection
at risk and enabling an extension of their coercive power well beyond their borders. As a result, the United
States may be unable to employ forces with complete freedom of action. The ability of U.S. forces to
deliberately build up combat po wer, perform detailed rehearsals  and integration activities, and then conduct
operations on their own initiative will likely be significantly  challenged. Threats might use cyberspace attack
capabilities (such as disruptive and destructive malware), elec tronic warfare, and space capabilities (such as
anti-satellite weapons) to disrupt U.S. communications; positio ning, navigation, and timing; synchronization;
and freedom of maneuver. Finally, enemies may attempt to strike  installations outside the continental United
States to disrupt or delay deployment of forces. These types of  threats are not specific to any single theater
of operations, since they have few geographic constraints.
1-24. When dealing with nuclear powered adversaries, the JFC may  face constraints to mitigate risk of
escalation. Tensions may heighten when employing ground forces that will operate close to an enemy â€™s
border or when exploiting offensive success in ways that threat en the viability of an enemy government to
maintain power. Because of the potential for nuclear escalation , Army commanders and staffs should
consider tensions and the overall strategic situation as they d evelop operational approaches at their particular
echelon.
1-25. Violent extremist organizations work to undermine regional  security in areas such as the Middle East
and North Africa. Such groups radicalize populations, incite vi olence, and employ terror to impose their
visions on fragile societies. They are strongest where governme nts are weakest, exploiting people trapped in
fragile or failed states. Violent extremist organizations often  coexist with criminal organizations, where both
profit from illicit trade and th e spread of corruption, further  undermining security and stability.
WAR AS A HUMAN ENDEAVOR 
1-26. War is chaotic, lethal, and a fundamentally human endeavor . It is a clash of wills fought among and
between people. All war is inherently about changing human beha vior, with each side trying to alter the
behavior of the other by force of arms. Success requires the ab ility to out think an opponent and ruthlessly
exploit the opportunities that come from positions of relative advantage. The side that best understands an
operational environment adapts mor e rapidly and decides to act more quickly in conditions of uncertainty is
the one most likely to win.
1-27. War is inextricably tied to the populations inhabiting the  land domain. All military capabilities are
ultimately linked to land and, in most cases, the ability to pr evail in ground combat becomes a decisive factor
in breaking an enemy â€™s will. Understanding the human context that enables the enemy â€™s will, which includes
culture, economics, and history, is as important as understandi ng the enemy â€™s military capabilities.
Commanders cannot presume that superior military capability alo ne creates the desired effects on an enemy.
Military Operations 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 1-5 Commanders must continually assess whether their operations are  influencing enemies and populations, 
eroding the enemy â€™s will, and achieving the commanders â€™ intended purpose. 
1-28.  When unified land operations occur among populations, they infl uence and are influenced by those 
populations. The results of these interactions are often unpred ictable â€”and potentially uncontrollable. 
Commanders should seek to do less harm than good to gain the su pport of populations and, when possible, 
to influence their behaviors. Gaining support requires a combin ation of both coercion and incentives, the 
exact mix of which is unique to each case. During operations to  shape operational environments and prevent 
conflicts, the scale is weighted heavily towards incentivizing desired behavior. However, in large-scale 
combat operations, coercion may play a larger role. Large-scale combat operations are extensive joint 
combat operations in terms of scope and size of forces committe d, conducted as a campaign aimed at 
achieving operational and strategic objectives.  Consolidating gains requires a more balanced approach. 
Regardless of the context, U.S. forces always operate consisten tly with international law and their rules of 
engagement.  
1-29.  U.S. military forces operate to achieve the goals and accomplis h the objectives assigned to them by 
the President and Secretary of Defense. Normally, these goals a nd objectives involve establishing security 
conditions favorable to U.S. interests. Army forces do this as a function of unified action.  
ARMY STRATEGIC ROLES 
1-30.  The Army â€™s primary mission is to organize, train, and equip its forces t o conduct prompt and sustained 
land combat to defeat enemy ground forces and seize, occupy, an d defend land areas. The Army accomplishes 
its mission by supporting the joint force and unified action pa rtners in four strategic roles: shape operational 
environments, prevent conflict,  prevail in large-scale ground c ombat, and consolidate gains. The strategic 
roles clarify the enduring reasons for which the Army is organi zed, trained, and equipped. Strategic roles are 
not tasks assigned to subordinate units.  
SHAPE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS  
1-31.  Army operations to shape bring together all the activities inte nded to promote regional stability and to 
set conditions for a favorable outcome in the event of a milita ry confrontation. Army operations to shape help 
dissuade adversary activities designed to achieve regional goal s short of military conflict. As part of 
operations to shape, the Army provides trained and ready forces  to geographic combatant commanders to 
support their combatant command campaign plan. The theater army  and subordinate Army forces help the 
geographic combatant commander in building partner capacity and  capability while promoting stability 
across an area of responsibility.  Army operations to shape are continuous throughout a geographic combatant 
commanderâ€™s area of responsibility  and occur before, during, and after a joint operation within a n operational 
area.  
1-32.  Shaping activities include security cooperation and forward pre sence to promote U.S. interests, 
developing allied and friendly military capabilities for self-d efense and multinational operations, 
continuously setting the theater for operations and training wh ile providing U.S. forces with peacetime and 
contingency access to a host nation. Regionally aligned and eng aged Army forces are essential to 
accomplishing objectives to strengthen the global network of mu ltinational partners and preventing conflict. 
The Army garrisons forces and pre-positions equipment in areas to allow national leaders to respond quickly 
to contingencies. Operational read iness, training, and planning  for potential operations by Army forces 
represent home station activities  that are part of operations t o shape.  
PREVENT CONFLICT  
1-33.  Army operations to prevent include all activities to deter unde sirable actions by an adversary. These 
operations are typically in response to indications and warning s that an adversary intends to take military 
action counter to U.S. interests, or in response to adversary a ctivities that are ongoing. They are intended to 
change an adversary â€™s risk calculus by raising the adversaryâ€™s costs for actions that threaten U.S. interests. 
Prevent activities are generally weighted toward actions to pro tect friendly forces, asse ts, and partners, and 
to indicate U.S. intent to execute subsequent phases of a plann ed operation. As part of a joint force, Army 
forces may have a significant role in the execution of directed  flexible deterrent options and flexible response 
Chapter 1 
1-6 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 options. Army prevent activities may include mobilization, forc e tailoring, and other predeployment 
activities. They may also involve initial deployment into a the ater of operations, including echeloning 
command posts, employing intelli gence collection assets, and fu rther developing communications, 
sustainment, and protection infrastructure to support the JFC â€™s concept of operations. Regardless of the 
methods used to raise the potential cost for an adversary, the primary deterrent to conflict is the demonstrated 
ability of a properly manned, equipped, and trained joint force  to prevail in large-scale combat. 
PREVAIL IN LARGE -SCALE GROUND COMBAT
1-34. During large-scale ground combat operations, Army forces f ocus on the defeat and destruction of
enemy ground forces as part of the joint team. Army forces clos e with and destroy  enemy forces in any
terrain, exploit success, and break the opponent â€™s will to resist. Army forces attack, defend, perform stability
tasks, and consolidate gains to accomplish national objectives.  Divisions and corps are the formations central
to the conduct of large-scale combat operations. The ability to  prevail in ground combat is a decisive factor
in breaking an enemy â€™s capability and will to continue a conflict. Conflict resoluti on requires the Army to
conduct sustained operations with unified action partners as lo ng as necessary to accomplish national
objectives.
CONSOLIDATE GAINS
1-35. Army operations to consolidate gains  are activities to make enduring any temporary operational
success and to set the conditions for a sustainable security en vironment, allowing for a transition of
control to other legitimate authorities. Consolidation of gains is an integral and continuous part of ar med
conflict, and it is necessary for  achieving success across the range of military operations. Army forces
deliberately plan to consolidate gains throughout an operation as part of defeating the enemy in detail to
accomplish overall political and strategic objectives. Early an d effective consolidation activities are a form
of exploitation performed while other operations are ongoing, a nd they enable the achievement of lasting
favorable outcomes in the shortest time span. Army forces perfo rm these activities through decisive action
with unified action partners. In some instances, Army forces wi ll be in charge of integrating forces and
synchronizing activities to con solidate gains. In other situati ons, Army forces will be in support. Army forces
may consolidate gains for a sustained period of time over large  land areas. While Army forces consolidate
gains throughout an operation, consolidating gains becomes the overall focus of Army forces after large-scale
combat operations have concluded.
UNIFIED ACTION 
1-36. Unified action  is the synchronization, coord ination, and/or integration of th e activities of governmental
and nongovernmental entities with  military operations to achiev e unity of effort (JP 1). Unity of effort  is
coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants are not necessarily part of
the same command or organization, which is the product of succe ssful unified action (JP 1). Unified action
partners  are those military forces, govern mental and nongovernmental or ganizations, and elements of
the private sector with whom Army forces plan, coordinate, sync hronize, and integrate during the
conduct of operations.  Military forces play a key role in unified action before, duri ng, and after operations.
The Army â€™s contribution to unified action is unified land operations. (S ee paragraphs 3-1 through 3-2 for a
detailed discussion of unified land operations.)
1-37. The Army is the dominant U.S. fighting force in the land d omain. Army forces both depend upon and
enable the joint force across multiple domains, including air, land, maritime, space, a nd cyberspace. This
mutual interdependence creates powerful synergies and reflects that all operations are combined arms
operations, and all combined arms operations are conducted in m ultiple domains. The Army depends on the
other Services for strategic and operational mobility, joint fi res, and other key enabling capabilities. The
Army supports other Services, combatant commands, and unified a ction partners with ground-based indirect
fires and ballistic missile defense, defensive cyberspace opera tions, electronic protection, communications,
intelligence, rotary-wing aircraft, logistics, and engineering.
1-38. The Army â€™s ability to set and sustain the theater of operations is essen tial to allowing the joint force
freedom of action. The Army establishes, maintains, and defends  vital infrastructure. It also provides the JFC
Military Operations 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 1-7 with unique capabilities, such as port and airfield opening; lo gistics; chemical defense; and reception, staging, 
and onward movement, and integration of forces.  
1-39.  Interagency coordination is a key part of unified action. Interagency coordination  is within the context 
of Department of Defense involvement, the coordination that occ urs between elements of Department of 
Defense, and participating United States Government departments  and agencies for the purpose of achieving 
an objective (JP 3-0). Army forces conduct and participate in i nteragency coordination using established 
liaison, personal engagement, and planning processes.  
1-40.  Unified action may require inter organizational cooperation to b uild the capacity of unified action 
partners. Interorganizational cooperation  is interaction that occurs among elements of the Department of  
Defense; participating United States Government departments and  agencies; state, territorial, local, and tribal 
agencies; foreign military forces and government agencies; inte rnational organizations; nongovernmental 
organizations; and the private sector (JP 3-08). Building partn er capacity helps to secure populations, protects 
infrastructure, and strengthens institutions as a means of prot ecting common security interests. Building 
partner capacity results from comprehensive interorganizational  activities, programs, and military-to-military 
engagements united by a common purpose. The Army integrates cap abilities of operating forces and the 
institutional force to support interorganizational capacity-bui lding efforts, primarily through security 
cooperation interactions.  
1-41.  Security cooperation  is all Department of Defense interactions with foreign securit y establishments to 
build security relationships that promote specific United State s security interests, develop allied and partner 
nation military and security capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide United 
States forces with peacetime and contingency access to allied a nd partner nations (JP 3-20). Security 
cooperation provides the means to build partner capacity and ac complish strategic objectives. These 
objectives include â€” 
z Building defensive and security relationships that promote U.S.  security interests. 
z Developing capabilities for sel f-defense and multinational oper ations. 
z Providing U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to host nations to increase situational 
understanding of an operational environment. 
1-42.  Army forces support the objectives of the combatant commander â€™s campaign plan in accordance with 
appropriate policy, legal frameworks, and authorities. The plan  supports those objectives through security 
cooperation, specifically those involving security force assist ance and foreign internal defense. Security force 
assistance  is the Department of Defense activities that support the devel opment of the capacity and capability 
of foreign security forces and t heir supporting institutions (J P 3-20). Foreign internal defense  is participation 
by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of the  action programs taken by another government 
or other designated organization to free and protect its societ y from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency, 
terrorism, and other threats to its security (JP 3-22).  
1-43.  Security force assistance and foreign internal defense professi onalize and develop security partner 
capacity to enable synchronized sustaining operations. Army sec urity cooperation interactions enable other 
interorganizational efforts to bu ild partner capacity. Army for cesâ€”including special operations forces â€”
advise, assist, train, and equip partner units to develop unit and individual proficiency in security operations. 
The institutional force advises and trains partner army activit ies to build institutional capacity for professional 
education, force generation, and force sustainment. (See FM 3-2 2 for more information on Army support to 
security cooperation.)  
COOPERATION WITH CIVILIAN ORGANIZATIONS  
1-44.  When directed, Army forces provide sustainment and security for  civilian organizations, since many 
lack these capabilities. Within the context of interagency coor dination, this refers to non-Department of 
Defense (DOD) agencies of the U.S. Government. Other government  agencies include, but are not limited 
to, Departments of State, Justice, Transportation, and Agricult ure.  
1-45.  An intergovernmental organizatio n is an organization created by  a formal agreement between two or 
more governments on a global, regional, or functional basis to protect and promote national interests shared 
by member states. Intergovernmental organizations may be establ ished on a global, regional, or functional 
Chapter 1 
1-8 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 basis for wide-ranging or narrowly defined purposes. Examples i nclude the United Nations and the European 
Union.  
1-46. A nongovernmental organization is a private, self-governing, not-for-profit organization dedic ated to
alleviating human suffering; and/or promoting education, health  care, economic development, environmental
protection, human rights, and conflict resolution; and/or encou raging the establishment of democratic
institutions and civil society (JP 3-08). Their mission is gene rally humanitarian and not one concerned with
assisting the military in accomplishing its objectives. In some  circumstances, nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) may provide humanitarian aid simultaneously to elements of both sides in a conflict. Nevertheless,
there are many situations where t he interests of Army forces an d NGOs overlap.
1-47. A contractor is a person o r business operating under a leg al agreement to provide products or services
for pay. A contractor furnishes supplies and services or perfor ms work at a certain price or rate based on
contracted terms. Contracted s upport includes traditional goods  and services support, but it may also include
interpreter communications, infrastructure, and other related s upport. Contractor employees include
contractors authorized to accompany the force as a formal part of the force and local national employees who
normally have no special legal status. (See ATP 4-10 for more i nformation on contractors.)
1-48. Most civilian organizations are not under military control , nor does the American ambassador or a
United Nations commissioner cont rol them. Civilian organization s have different organizational cultures and
norms. Some may be willing to work with Army forces; others may  not. Civilian organizations may arrive
well after military operations have begun, making personal cont act and team building essential. Command
emphasis on immediate and continuous coordination encourages ef fective cooperation. Commanders should
establish liaison with civilian organizations to integrate thei r efforts as much as possible with Army and joint
operations. Civil affairs units typically establish this liaiso n. (See FM 3-57 for more information on civil
affairs units.)
MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS
1-49. Multinational operations  is a collective term to describe military actions conducted by  forces of two
or more nations, usually undertaken within the structure of a c oalition or alliance (JP 3-16). While each nation
has its own interests and often participates within the limitat ions of national caveats, all nations bring value
to an operation. Each nation â€™s force has unique capabilities, and each usually contributes t o an operation â€™s
legitimacy in terms of international or local acceptability. Ar my forces should anticipate that most operations
will be multinational operations and plan accordingly. (See FM 3-16 for more information on multinational
operations.)
1-50. An alliance  is the relationship that results from a formal agreement betwe en two or more nations for
broad, long-term objectives that further the common interests o f the members (JP 3-0). Military alliances,
such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (commonly known as NATO), allow partners to establish
formal, standard agreements.
1-51. A coalition is an arrangement between two or more nations for common action. Nations usually form
coalitions for specific, limited purposes. A coalition action i s an action outside the bounds of established
alliances, usually in a narrow area of common interest. Army fo rces may participate in coalition actions under
the authority of a United Nations â€™ resolution.
1-52. Multinational operations present challenges and demands. T hese include cultural and language issues,
interoperability challenges, national caveats on the use of res pective forces, the sharing of information and
intelligence, and the rules of engagement. Commanders analyze t he particular requirements of a mission in
the context of friendly force capabilities to exploit the multi national force â€™s advantages and compensate for
its limitations. Establishing effective liaison with multinatio nal partners is critical to  situational awareness.
1-53. Multinational sustainment requires detailed planning and c oordination. Normally each nation provides
a national support element to sustain its forces. However, inte grated multinational sustainment may improve
efficiency and effectiveness. Whe n authorized and directed, an Army theater sustainment command can
provide logistics and other support to multinational forces. In tegrating support requirements of several
nations â€™ forces â€”often spread over considerable distances and across internation al boundaries â€”is critical to
the success of multinational op erations and requires flexibilit y, patience, and persistence.
Military Operations 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 1-9 JOINT OPERATIONS  
1-54.  Single Services may perform tasks  and missions to support DOD o bjectives. However, the DOD 
primarily employs two or more Services (from two military depar tments) in a single operation across multiple 
domains, particularly in combat, through joint operations. Joint operations  are military actions conducted by 
joint forces and those Service forces employed in specified com mand relationships with each other, which 
of themselves, do not establish joint forces (JP 3-0). A joint force  is a force composed of elements, assigned 
or attached, of two or more Military Departments operating unde r a single joint force commander (JP 3-0). 
Joint operations exploit the adva ntages of interdependent Servi ce capabilities in multiple domains through 
unified action. Joint planning integrates military power with o ther instruments of national power (diplomatic, 
economic, and informational) to achieve a desired military end state. The end state  is the set of required 
conditions that defines achievement of the commander â€™s objectives (JP 3-0). Joint planning connects the 
strategic end state to the JFC â€™s operational campaign design a nd ultimately to tactical missio ns. JFCs use 
campaigns and major operations to translate their operational-l evel actions into strategic results. A campaign  
is a series of related operations aimed at achieving strategic and operational objectives within a given time 
and space (JP 5-0). A major operation  is a series of tactical actions (battles, engagements, strikes ) conducted 
by combat forces, coordinated in time and place, to achieve str ategic or operational objectives in an 
operational area (JP 3-0). Planni ng for a campaign is appropria te when the contemplated military operations 
exceed the scope of a single major operation. Campaigns are alw ays joint operations. Army forces do not 
conduct campaigns unless they are designated as a joint task fo rce (JTF). However, Army forces contribute 
to campaigns through the conduct of land operations. (See JP 5- 0 for a discussion of campaigns.)  
LAND OPERATIONS  
1-55.  An operation  is a sequence of tactical actions with a common purpose or uni fying theme (JP 1). The 
Army â€™s primary mission is to organize,  train, and equip forces to co nduct prompt and sustained land combat 
operations and perform such other duties, not otherwise assigne d by law, as may be prescribed by the 
President or the Secretary of Defense (as described in Title 10 , United States Code). The Army does this 
through its operational concept of unified land operations. (Se e paragraphs 3-1 through 3-2 for a detailed 
discussion of unified land operations.) Army doctrine aligns wi th joint doctrine, and it is informed by the 
nature of land operations. Army forces are employed in accordan ce with the character of the threat and 
friendly force capabilities. They conduct operations to preserv e vital national interests, most important of 
which are the sovereignty of the homeland and the preservation of the U.S. constitutional form of 
government. Army forces are prepared to operate across the rang e of military operations and integrate with 
unified action partners as part of a larger effort. 
1-56.  Army forces, with unified action partners, conduct land operati ons to shape security environments, 
prevent conflict, prevail in ground combat, and consolidate gai ns. Army forces provide multiple options for 
responding to and resolving crises. Army forces defeat enemy fo rces, control terrain, secure populations, and 
preserve joint force freedom of action.  
1-57.  The dynamic interaction among friendly forces, enemy forces, ad versaries, neutral parties, and the 
environment make land operations exceedingly complex. Understan ding each of these elements separately is 
necessary, but not sufficient, to understand their relationship s with each other. Understanding the context of 
dynamic interaction in each case helps determine what constitut es positions of relative advantage. Exploiting 
positions of relative advantage allows Army forces to defeat ad versaries and enemies at least cost.  
1-58.  Joint doctrine discusses traditional war as a confrontation bet ween nation-states or coalitions of 
nation-states. This confrontation typically involves small-scal e to large-scale, force-on-force military 
operations in which enemies use various conventional and unconv entional military capabilities against each 
other. Landpower heavily influences the outcome of wars even wh en it is not the definitive instrument. 
Landpower  is the ability â€”by threat, force, or occupation â€”to gain, sustain, and exploit control over 
land, resources, and people.  Landpower is the basis of unif ied land operations. Landpower i ncludes the 
ability to â€” 
z Protect and defend U.S. nati onal assets and interests. 
z Impose the Nation â€™s will on an enemy, by force if necessary.  
z Sustain high tempo operations. 
Chapter 1 
1-10 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 zEngage to influence, shape, prev ent, and deter in an operationa l environment.
zDefeat enemy organizations and control terrain.
zSecure populations and consolidate gains.
zEstablish and maintain a stable environment that sets the condi tions for political and economic
development.
zAddress the consequences of catastrophic events â€”both natural and man-made â€”to restore
infrastructure and reestablish civil services.
ARMY FORCES AND EXPEDITIONARY CAPABILITY AND CAMPAIGN QUALITY
1-59. Swift campaigns, however desirable, are the historical exc eption. Whenever objectives involve
controlling populations or dominating terrain, campaign success  usually requires employing landpower for
protracted periods. The Army â€™s combination of expeditionary capability and campaign quality contributes
sustained landpower to support unified action.
1-60. Expeditionary capability describes the ability to promptly  deploy combined arms forces on short notice
to any location in the world, capable of conducting operations immediately upon arrival. Expeditionary
operations are entirely dependen t upon joint air and maritime s upport. Operational reach  is the distance and
duration across which a force can successfully employ military capabilities (JP 3-0). Adequate operational
reach is a necessity for forces to conduct decisive action. (Se e paragraphs 3-3 through 3-36 for a detailed
discussion of decisive action.) Extending operational reach is a significant concern for commanders. To
achieve a desired end state, forces must possess the necessary operational reach to establish and maintain
conditions that define success. Commanders and staffs increase operational reach through deliberate, focused
planning â€”well in advance of operations when possible â€”and the appropriate sustainment to facilitate
endurance.
1-61. Expeditionary capabilities are more than physical attribut es; they begin with a mindset that permeates
the force. The ability to deploy the right combination of Army forces to the right place at the right time
requires unit leadership focused on the training and readiness essential to deploying. Forward deployed units,
forward positioned capabilities, and force projection â€”from anywhere in the world â€”all contribute to the
Army â€™s expeditionary capabilities. Providing JFCs with expeditionary  capabilities requires forces organized
and equipped to be versatile and rapidly deployable, and able t o sustain operations over time.
1-62. Campaign quality describes the Army â€™s ability to sustain operations as long as necessary to achieve
success. Campaign quality is an ability to conduct sustaining o perations for as long as necessary, adapting to
unpredictable and often profound changes in an operational envi ronment as a campaign unfolds. Army forces
are organized, trained, and equipp ed for endurance. They are es sential to the JFC for the conduct of
campaigns. Campaigning requires a mindset and vision that compl ements expeditionary requirements. Army
leaders understand the effects of  protracted land operations on  units and adjust the tempo of operations
whenever circumstances allow to  prolong their effectiveness.
CLOSE COMBAT
1-63. The nature of close combat in land operations is unique. C ombatants routinely come face-to-face with
one another in large numbers in a wide variety of operational e nvironments comprising all types of terrain.
When other means fail to drive enemy forces from their position s, Army forces close with and destroy or
capture them. The outcome of battles and engagements depends on  the ability of Army forces to close with
enemy forces and prevail in close combat. Close combat  is warfare carried out on land in a direct-fire
fight, supported by direct and i ndirect fires and other assets.  Units involved in close combat employ
direct fire weapons supported by indirect fire, air-delivered f ires, and nonlethal engagement means. Units in
close combat defeat or destroy enemy forces and seize and retai n ground. Close combat at lower echelons
contains many more interactions between friendly and enemy forc es than any other form of combat.
1-64. Close combat is most often linked to difficult terrain whe re enemies seek to negate friendly advantages
in technology and weapon capabilities. Urban terrain represents  one of the most likely close combat
challenges. The complexity of urban terrain and the density of noncombatants reduce the effectiveness of
advanced sensors and long-range weapons. Operations in large, d ensely populated areas require special
considerations. From a planning pe rspective, commanders view ci ties as both topographic features and a
Military Operations 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 1-11 dynamic system of varying operational entities containing hosti le forces, local populations, and 
infrastructure.  
1-65.  Effective close combat relies on lethality informed by a high d egree of situational understanding across 
multiple domains. The capacity for physical destruction is the foundation of all other military capabilities, 
and it is building block of military operations. Army formation s are organized, equipped, and trained to 
employ lethal capabilities in a wide range of conditions. The d emonstrated lethality of Army forces provides 
the credibility essential to deterring adversaries and assuring  allies and partners.  
1-66.  An inherent, complementary relationship exists between using le thal force and applying military 
capabilities for nonlethal purposes. In wartime, each situation  requires a different mix of violence and 
constraint. Lethal and nonlethal actions used together compleme nt each other and create multiple dilemmas 
for opponents. During operations short of armed conflict, the l ethality implicit in Army forces enables their 
performance of other tasks effectively with minimal adversary i nterference.  
SEIZE, RETAIN, AND EXPLOIT TH E OPERATIONAL INITIATIVE  
1-67.  Operational initiative  is the setting of tempo and terms of action throughout an oper ation. Army 
forces seize, retain, and exploit operational initiative by for cing the enemy to respond to friendly action. By 
presenting an enemy force multiple dilemmas across multiple dom ains, commanders force that enemy to 
react continuously until driven into an untenable position. Exp loiting operational initiative pressures enemy 
commanders to abandon their preferred options, react to friendl y actions, and make mistakes. As enemy 
forces make mistakes or weaken, friendly forces seize opportuni ties that create new avenues for exploitation.  
1-68.  Commanders seize operational in itiative by acting across multip le domains simultaneously. Without 
action, seizing operational initiative is impossible. Faced wit h an uncertain situation, commanders naturally 
tend to hesitate and gather more information to reduce uncertai nty. Waiting for more information might 
reduce uncertainty, but it never eliminates it. Waiting for per fect friendly situational awareness and 
synchronization provides an adaptive enemy force the time to se ize or regain operational initiative. Successful 
commanders manage uncertainty by developing the situation throu gh action, using reconnaissance, 
surveillance, and other capabilit ies to identify opportunities across multiple domains t hat can be exploited.  
1-69.  Seizing operational initiative means setting and dictating the terms of action throughout an operation. 
Commanders plan to seize the in itiative as early as possible. E ffective planning determines where, when, and 
how that happens. Enemy forces will actively try to retain oper ational initiative and disrupt friendly plans, 
so good plans rapidly executed are fundamental to seizing the i nitiative. During execution, commanders 
exploit opportunities to attack and deceive enemy command and c ontrol elements to prevent their 
synchronization of combat power and achieve surprise. Seizing t he operational initiative usually requires 
accepting risk. Commanders and staffs assess if they have the i nitiative and determine how to seize it if they 
do not. These conditions generally indicate that friendly force s have operational initiative:  
z Friendly forces are no longer decisively engaged or threatened with decisive engagement. 
z Subordinate commanders are able to mass combat power or concent rate forces at times and places 
of their choosing. 
z Enemy forces no longer offer effective resistance and do not ap pear capable of reestablishing 
resistance. 
z Friendly forces encounter lighter-than-anticipated enemy resist ance or large numbers of prisoners.  
z Friendly rates of advance suddenly accelerate or casualty rates  suddenly drop. 
1-70.  Retaining operational initiative requires sustained, relentless  pressure on enemy forces. Commanders 
maintain pressure by synchronizing the warfighting functions to  p r e s e n t  e n e m y  c o m m a n d e r s  w i t h  
continuously changing combinations of combat power at a tempo t hey cannot effectively counter. 
Commanders and staffs use information collection assets to iden tify enemy attempts to regain the initiative. 
Effective information management to process information quickly  is essential for staying inside the enemyâ€™s 
decision-making cycle. Combined with effective planning, inform ation management helps commanders 
anticipate enemy actions and develo p branches, sequels, or adju stments.  
Chapter 1 
1-12 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 READINESS THROUGH TRAINING 
1-71. Training is the most important thing the Army does to prep are for operations. It is the cornerstone of
combat readiness and the foundation for successful operations. Effective training must be commander driven,
rigorous, realistic, and to the standard and under the conditio ns that units expect to operate in during combat.
Realistic training with limited t ime and resources demands that  commanders focus their unit training efforts
to maximize repetitions under varying conditions to build profi ciency. Units execute effective individual and
collective training based on the Army â€™s principles of training as described in ADP 7-0. Through train ing and
leader development, units achieve the tactical and technical co mpetence that builds confidence and allows
them to conduct successful operations across the competition co ntinuum. Achieving this competence requires
specific, dedicated training on offensive, defensive, and stabi lity or defense support of civil authorities
(DSCA) tasks. Training continues in deployed units to sustain s kills and to adapt to changes in an operational
environment. (See ADP 7-0 for training doctrine.)
1-72. Army training includes a system of techniques and standard s that allows Soldiers and units to
determine, acquire, and practice necessary skills. The Army â€™s training system emphasizes experiential
practice and learning to build teamwork and cohesion within uni ts. It recognizes that Soldiers ultimately fight
for one another and their units. Training instills discipline. It conditions Soldiers to operate within the law of
war and rules of engagement. Training prepares unit leaders for  the harsh reality of land combat by
emphasizing the fluid and disorderly conditions inherent in lan d operations. Effective training accounts for
cyberspace, space, and information-related capabilities that in fluence the warfighting functions.
Well-rounded training includes candid assessments, after action  reviews, and applied lessons learned to
ensure improved readiness. Adversaries assess the training read iness of Army forces continuously, which is
how training helps to shape operational environments. Training creates combat credibility, which contributes
to deterrence.

Operational Art 
This chapter discusses the application and elements of operatio nal art. It also discusses 
defeat and stability mechanisms.
THE APPLICATION OF OPERATIONAL ART 
Operational art is the cognitive approach by commanders and staffs â€”supported by their skill, 
knowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment â€”to develop strategies, campaigns, and operations to 
organize and employ military forc es by integrating ends, ways, and means (JP 3-0). It is the essence of 
applying skill, experience, and judgment when exercising militar y command at the operational-level of 
warfare, and serves two main functions â€”
zTo ensure that military actions are aligned with, and directly support strategy.
zTo ensure that tactical actions occ ur under the most advantageo us conditions possible.
Commanders and their staffs apply operational art throughout all  phases of the operations process.
Army commanders use operational art, the principles of joint ope rations, and the elements of operational art
to envision how to establish conditions that accomplish their m issions and objectives. For Army forces, 
operational art is the pursuit of strategic objectives, in whol e or in part, through the arrangement of tactical 
actions in time, space, and pur pose. Operational art applies to  all types and aspects of operations. 
The twelve principles of joint operations represent important fa ctors that affect the conduct of 
operations across the levels of wa rfare. (See table 2-1) The pr inciples are broadly applied considerations and 
their relevance varies in each situation. They are not a checkl ist. Commanders generally consider all twelve 
principles, but they may not apply them in the same way in every  operation. The principles summarize the 
characteristics of successful operations throughout history. Th eir greatest value lies in educating military 
professionals. While considering the principles of joint operat ions, commanders determine if or when to 
deviate from the principles based on the current situation. (Se e JP 3-0 for a detailed discussion on the 
principles of joint operations.) 
Table 2-1. Principles of joint operations 
Objective : Direct every military operation toward a clearly defined, dec isive, and achievable goal.
Offensive : Seize, retain, and exploit the initiative.
Mass : Concentrate the effects of combat power at the most advantage ous place and time to produce 
decisive results.
Maneuver : Place the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the fle xible application of combat 
power.
Economy of force : Expend minimum-essential combat power on secondary efforts to  allocate the 
maximum possible combat p ower on primary efforts.
Unity of command : Ensure unity of effort under one responsible commander for ev ery objective.
Security : Prevent the enemy from acquiring an unexpected advantage.
Surprise : Strike at a time or place or in a manner for which the enemy is unprepared.
Simplicity : Increase the probability that plans and operations will be ex ecuted as intended by preparing 
clear, uncomplicated plans and concise mission orders.
Restraint : Limit collateral damage and prevent the unnecessary use of fo rce.
Perseverance : Ensure the commitment necessary to attain the national strate gic end state.
Legitimacy : Maintain legal and moral authority in the conduct of operatio ns.
Chapter 2 
2-2 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 
When applying operational art, co mmanders and staffs ensure a sh ared understanding of purpose. This 
requires open, continuous collaboration between commanders at v arious echelons to define accurately the 
problems and conditions of an operational environment. Effectiv e collaboration facilitates assessment, fosters 
critical analysis, and anticipates opportunities and risk. 
Operational art encompasses all levels, from strategic directio n to tactical actions. It requires creative 
vision, broad experience, and a knowledge of capabilities, tact ics, and techniques across multiple domains. 
It is through operational art th at commanders translate their o perational approach into a concept of operations. 
Aconcept of operations is a verbal or graphic statement that clearly and concisely exp resses what the 
commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using a vailable resources (JP 5-0). Commanders 
then position and maneuver force s to perform tasks that best ach ieve a desired end state. 
The successful application of ope rational art relies heavily on  the science of operations. Considerations 
such as movement times, capability ranges, loiter times, consum ption rates, available supplies, combat power 
status, and electromagnetic spectr um management determine wheth er an operational approach is feasible or 
not. Many operational approaches prove unhelpful for driving de tailed planning because they fail to consider 
operational realities. The ear lier details are integrated into conceptual planning, the better.
During planning, commanders and their staffs use the Army desig n methodology to develop an 
operational approach that informs detailed planning. The Army design methodology is a methodology for 
applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualiz e, and describe unfamiliar problems and 
approaches to solving them (ADP 5-0). By applying the Army desig n methodology, commanders and staffs 
gain a shared understanding of the environment, and they can de fine the problems preventing the desired end 
state. This differs from mission analysis, since it is not miss ion specific. (See figure 2-1.) These items enable 
commanders and staffs using Army design methodology:
zThe principles of joint operations and principles of war.
zThe tenets of unified land operations.
zThe elements of operational art.
zThe defeat mechanisms.
zThe stability mechanisms.
Operational Art 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 2-3 Figure 2-1. Army design methodology 
 Army design methodology results in an operational approach , a broad description of the mission, 
operational concepts, tasks, and actions required to accomplish  the mission (JP 5-0). A good operational 
approach provides the basis for detailed planning, allows leade rs to establish a logical operational framework, 
and helps produce an executable order. As detailed planning yie lds new information, leaders reassess their 
operational approach â€”and the Army design methodology that informed it â€”and adjust it accordingly to 
ensure relevancy. These actions continue throughout preparation  a n d  e x e c u t i o n ,  a n d  t h e y  i n f o r m  
commanders â€™ decision-making. When assessing operations, the logic of the o perational approach provides 
the basis for developing assessment criteria, including measure s of performance and effectiveness. (See 
ADP 5-0 for more information on assessments.) 
 The understanding developed with the Army design methodology en ables commanders to develop an 
operational approach that establishes conditions to accomplish the mission. (See figure 2-2 on page 2-4.) The 
operational approach provides a framework that relates tactical  tasks to the desired end state. It provides a 
unifying purpose and focus to all operations.

DEFEAT AND STABILITY MECHANISMS 
Defeat is to render a force incapable of achieving its objectives . Defeat has a temporal component 
and is seldom permanent. When developing an operational approac h, commanders consider methods to 
employ a combination of defeat mechanisms and stability mechanis ms. Defeat mechanisms relate to 
offensive and defensive operations; stability mechanisms relate  to stability operations, security, and 
consolidating gains in a n area of operations. 
Adefeat mechanism is a method through which friendl y forces accomplish their miss ion against 
enemy opposition . Army forces at all echelons use combinations of four defeat m echanisms: destroy, 
dislocate, disintegrate, and isolate. Applying more than one de feat mechanism simultaneously produces 
complementary and reinforcing effects not attainable with a sin gle mechanism. Used individually, a defeat 
mechanism achieves results relative to how much effort is expen ded. Using defeat mechanisms in 
combination creates enemy dilemmas that magnify their effects s ignificantly. 
When commanders destroy, they apply lethal combat power on an e nemy capability so that it can no 
longer perform any function. Destroy is a tactical mission task that physically renders an enemy for ce 
combat-ineffective until it is reconstituted. Alternatively, to destroy a combat system is to damage it so badly 
that it cannot perform any function or be restored to a usable condition without being entirely rebuilt 
(FM 3-90-1). An enemy cannot restore a destroyed force to a usabl e condition without entirely rebuilding it. 
Dislocate is to employ forces to obtain significant positional advantage,  rendering the enemy â€™s
dispositions less valuable, perhaps even irrelevant . Commanders often achieve dislocation by placing 
forces in locations where the enemy does not expect them. 
Disintegrate means to disrupt the enemy â€™s command and control system , degrading its ability to 
conduct operations while leading to a rapid collapse of the ene myâ€™s capabilities or will to fight .
Commanders often achieve disintegration by specifically targeti ng an enemy â€™s command structure and 
communications systems. 
Isolate means to separate a force from its sources of support in order t o reduce its effectiveness 
and increase its vulnerability to defeat. Isolation can encompass multiple domains and can have both 
physical and psychological effect s detrimental to accomplishing  a mission. Isolating a force in the 
electromagnetic spectrum exacerbates the effects of physical is olation by reducing its situational awareness. 
The ability of an isolated unit to perform its intended mission  generally degrades over time, decreasing its 
ability to interfere with an opposing force â€™s course of action. When command ers isolate, they deny an enemy  
or adversary access to capabilit ies that enable an enemy unit to  maneuver at will in time and space. 
Commanders describe defeat mechanisms by the three types of effe cts they produce: 
zPhysical effects are those things that are material.
zTemporal effects are those that  occur at a specific point in ti me.
zCognitive effects those that pertain to or affect the mind.

Operational Art 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 2-5 Operational art formulates the most effective, efficient way to  apply defeat mechanisms. Physically defeating 
an enemy deprives enemy forces of the ability to achieve those aims. Temporally defeating an enemy 
anticipates enemy reactions and counters them before they can b ecome effective. Cognitively defeating an 
enemy disrupts decision making and deprives that enemy of the w ill to fight.  
 In addition to defeating an enemy, Army forces often seek to st abilize an area of operations by 
performing stability tasks. Stability tasks are tasks conducted  as part of operations outside the United States 
in coordination with other instruments of national power to mai ntain or reestablish a safe and secure 
environment and provide essential governmental services, emerge ncy infrastructure reconstruction, and 
humanitarian relief. (See ADP 3-0 for more information on stabi lity.) There are six pr imary stability tasks:  
z Establish civil security. 
z Establish civil control. 
z Restore essential services. 
z Support governance. 
z Support economic and infrastructure development. 
z Conduct security cooperation. 
 The combination of stability tasks performed during operations depends on the situation. In some 
operations, the host nation can meet most or all of the populat ionâ€™s requirements. In those cases, Army forces 
work with and through host-nation authorities. Commanders use c ivil affairs operations to mitigate how the 
military presence affects the population and vice versa. Conver sely, Army forces operating in a failed state 
may need to support the local population and work with civilian  organizations to restore capabilities. Civil 
affairs operations are essential in establishing the trust betw een Army forces and civilian organizations 
required for effective working relationships.  
 A stability mechanism  is the primary method through which friendly forces affect civ ilians in 
order to attain conditions that support establishing a lasting,  stable peace . As with defeat mechanisms, 
combinations of stability mechanisms produce complementary and reinforcing effects that accomplish the 
mission more effectively and efficiently than single mechanisms  do alone.  
 The four stability mechanisms are compel, control, influence, a nd support. Compel means to use, or 
threaten to use, lethal force to establish control and dominanc e, affect behavioral change, or enforce 
compliance with mandates, agreements, or civil authority. Contr ol involves imposing civil order. Influence 
means to alter the opinions, attitudes, and ultimately the beha vior of foreign friendly, neutral, adversary, and 
enemy audiences through messages, presence, and actions. Suppor t establishes, reinforces, or sets the 
conditions necessary for the instruments of national power to f unction effectively.  
THE ELEMENTS OF OPERATIONAL ART  
 In applying operational art, Army commanders and their staffs u se intellectual tools to help understand 
an operational environment and visualize and describe their app roach to conducting an operation. 
Collectively, these tools are the elements of operational art. They help commanders understand, visualize, 
and describe the integration and synchronization of the element s of combat power and their commander â€™s 
intent and guidance. Commanders selectively use these tools in any operation. Their broadest application 
applies to long-term operations.  
 Not all elements of operational art apply at all levels of warf are. A company commander concerned 
about the tempo of an upcoming operation is probably not concer ned with an enemies â€™ center of gravity. A 
corps commander may consider all elements of operational art in  developing a plan to support the JFC. As 
such, the elements of operational art are flexible enough to ap ply when pertinent.  
 As some elements of operational design apply only to JFCs, the Army modifies the elements of 
operational design into elements of operational art by adding A rmy-specific elements. During the planning 
and execution of Army operations, commanders and staffs conside r the elements of operational art as they 
assess the situation. They adjust current and future operations  and plans as the operation unfolds, and they 
reframe as necessary. (See table 2-2 on page 2-6.)

ENDSTATE AND CONDITIONS
The end state is a set of desired future conditions the command er wants to exist when an operation 
ends. Commanders include the end state in their planning guidan ce. A clearly defined end state promotes 
unity of effort; facilitates integration, synchronization, and disciplined initiative; and helps mitigate risk. 
Army operations typically focus on achieving the military end s tate that may include contributions to 
establishing nonmilitary conditions. Commanders explicitly desc ribe the end state and its conditions for every 
operation. Otherwise, missions lack purpose, and operations los e focus. Successful commanders direct every 
operation toward a clearly defined, conclusive, and attainable end state (the objective). Most military 
operations require Army forces to consolidate gains to achieve a desired political end state, the exception 
being a punitive expedition. 
An end state may evolve as an ope ration progresses. Commanders c ontinuously monitor operations 
and evaluate their progress. They evaluate the validity of assu mptions and running estimates. Commanders 
use formal and informal assessment methods to assess their prog ress in achieving an end state and determine 
if they need to reframe. An end state should anticipate future o perations and set conditions for transitions. 
CENTER OF GRAVITY
Acenter of gravity is the source of power that provides moral or physical strength , freedom of action, 
or will to act (JP 5-0). The loss of a center of gravity can ul timately result in defeat. A center of gravity is an 
analytical tool for planning operations. It provides a focal po int and identifies sources of strength and 
weakness. However, the concept of center of gravity is only mea ningful when considered in relation to the 
objectives of the mission. Because most enemies represent adapti ve, complex systems, they are likely to have 
multiple centers of gravity. Destroying or capturing one is unl ikely to win a campaign or resolve most 
conflicts.
Centers of gravity are not limited to military forces, and they can be physical, moral, and virtual. They 
are part of a dynamic perspective of an operational environment , and they may change as an environment 
changes. Physical centers of gra vity, such as a capital city or  military force, are tangible and typically easier 
to identify, assess, and account for than moral centers of grav ity. Physical centers of gravity can often be 
influenced solely by military mean s. In contrast, moral centers  of gravity are intangible and more difficult to 
influence. They can include a charismatic leader, powerful rulin g elite, or united population. Military means 
alone usually prove ineffective when targeting moral centers of  gravity. Affecting them requires collective, 
integrated efforts of all instruments of national power. Likewi se, a virtual center of gravity may provide the 
ability to maintain unity of purpose for a disaggregated or dec entralized enemy which does not require mutual 
physical support to accomplish objectives and is not geographica lly bound. Virtual centers of gravity are 
usually associated with violent extremist ideologies and organi zations, non-nation state actors, or 
super-empowered individuals, although nation states could also have them. 
A center of gravity has subcomponents comprising a system, such  as command and control or logistics, 
which can be targeted for information collection and attack. Th is targeting can identify critical vulnerabilities 
in the system, such as communications or enemy morale, against which commanders can apply friendly 
capabilities. 
Operational Art 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 2-7 
Commanders analyze a center of gravity thoroughly and in detail . Faulty conclusions drawn from hasty 
or abbreviated analyses can adversely affect operations, waste critical resources, and incur undue risk. 
Thoroughly understanding an operational environment helps comma nders identify and target enemy centers 
of gravity. This understanding encompasses how enemies organize , fight, and make decisions. It includes 
their physical and moral strengths and weaknesses. This underst anding helps planners identify centers of 
gravity, their associated decisive  points, and the best approac h for achieving the desired end state.  
DECISIVE POINTS  
 A decisive point  is a geographic place, specific key event, critical factor, or  function that, when acted 
upon, allows commanders to gain a marked advantage over an enem y or contribute materially to achieving 
success (JP 5-0). Decisive points help commanders select clear,  conclusive, attainable objectives that directly 
contribute to achieving an end state. Geographic decisive point s can include port facilities, distribution 
networks and nodes, and bases of operation. Specific events and  elements of an enemy force can be decisive 
points. Examples of such events include commitment of the enemy  operational reserve and reopening a major 
oil refinery. Space and cyberspace-enabled capabilities may als o represent decisive points. 
 A common characteristic of decisive points is their importance to centers of gravity. Decisive points 
are not centers of gravity; they are key to attacking or protec ting centers of gravity, and they comprise parts 
of its system. A decisive point â€™s importance requires an enemy force to commit significant reso urces to 
defend it. The loss of a decisive point weakens a center of gra vity, and it may expose more decisive points. 
Identifying and attacking more decisive points can eventually l ead to an attack on the center of gravity itself. 
Commanders identify the decisive points that offer the greatest  physical, temporal, or psychological 
advantage against centers of gravity.  
 Decisive points apply to both the operational and tactical leve ls when shaping the concept of 
operations. Decisive points enab le commanders to seize, retain,  or exploit operational initiative. Controlling 
them is essential to mission accomplishment. Enemy control of a  decisive point may stall friendly 
momentum, force early culmination, or allow an enemy counteratt ack.  
LINES OF OPERATIONS AND LINES OF EFFORT  
 Lines of operations and lines of effort link objectives to the end state physically and conceptually. 
Commanders may describe an operation along lines of operations,  lines of effort, or a combination of both. 
The combination of them may change based on the conditions with in an area of operations. Commanders 
synchronize and sequence actions , deliberately creating complem entary and reinforcing effects. The lines 
then converge on the well-defin ed, commonly understood end stat e outlined in the commander â€™s intent.  
 Commanders at all levels may use lines of operations and lines of effort to develop tasks and allocate 
resources. Commanders may designate one line as the decisive op eration and others as shaping operations. 
Commanders synchronize and sequence related actions along multi ple lines. Seeing these relationships helps 
commanders assess progress toward achieving the end state as fo rces perform tasks and accomplish missions.  
Lines of Operations  
 A line of operations  is a line that defines the directional orientation of a force in time and space 
in relation to the enemy and links the force with its base of o perations and objectives . Lines of operations 
connect a series of decisive points that lead to control of a g eographic or force-oriented objective. Operations 
designed using lines of operations generally consist of a serie s of actions executed according to a well-defined 
sequence. A force operates on interior and exterior lines. Interior lines  are lines on which a force operates 
when its operations diverge from a central point . Interior lines allow commanders to move quickly against 
enemy forces along shorter lines of operation. Exterior lines  are lines on which a force operates when its 
operations converge on the enemy . Exterior lines allow commanders to concentrate forces against  multiple 
positions on the ground, thus presenting multiple dilemmas to t he enemy. Lines of operations tie offensive 
and defensive operations to the geographic and positional refer ences in the area of operations.  
Chapter 2 
2-8 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 Lines of Effort 
Aline of effort is a line that links multiple tasks using the logic of purpose rather than 
geographical reference to focus efforts toward establishing a d esired end state . Lines of effort are 
essential to long-term planning when positional references to a n enemy or adversary have little relevance. In 
operations involving many nonmilitary factors, lines of effort may be the only way to link tasks to the end 
state. Lines of effort are often essential to helping commander s visualize how military capabilities can support 
the other instruments of national power. 
Commanders use lines of effort to describe their vision of opera tions to achieve end state conditions. 
These lines of effort show how individual actions relate to eac h other and to achieving the end state. 
Commanders often use stability and DSCA tasks along lines of eff ort. These tasks link military actions with 
the broader interagency or interorganizational effort across th e levels of warfare. As operations progress, 
commanders may modify the lines of effort after assessing condi tions. Commanders use measures of 
performance and measures of effectiveness to continually assess  operations. A measure of performance is an 
indicator used to measure a friendly action that is tied to mea suring task accomplishment (JP 5-0). A measure 
of effectiveness in an indicator used to measure a current system state, with ch ange indicated by comparing 
multiple observations over time (JP 5-0).
Combining Lines of Operations and Lines of Effort 
Commanders use lines of operations and lines of effort to conne ct objectives to a central, unifying 
purpose. The difference between lines of operations and lines o f effort is that lines of operations are oriented 
on physical linkages, while lines of effort are oriented on log ical linkages. Combining lines of operations and 
lines of effort allows a commander to include stability or DSCA t asks in the long-term plan. This combination 
helps commanders begin consolidating gains and set the end stat e conditions for transitions in an operation. 
(See chapter 3 for a discussi on of consolidating gains.) 
TEMPO
Tempo is the relative speed and rhythm of military operations over ti me with respect to the 
enemy . It reflects the rate of military action. Controlling tempo he lps commanders keep operational initiative 
during combat operations or rapidly establish a sense of normal cy during humanitarian crises. During combat 
operations, commanders normally seek to maintain a higher tempo  than enemy forces do. A rapid tempo can 
overwhelm an enemy force â€™s ability to counter friendly actions. During other operations,  commanders act 
quickly to control events and d eny enemy forces positions of ad vantage. By acting faster than the situation 
deteriorates, commander s can change the dynamics of a crisis an d restore favorable conditions. 
Commanders control tempo throughout the conduct of operations. First, they formulate operations that 
exploit the complementary and reinforcing effects of simultaneo us and sequential operations. They 
synchronize those operations in time and space to degrade enemy  capabilities throughout the area of 
operations. Second, commanders avoid unnecessary engagements. T hey do this by bypassing resistance and 
avoiding places not considered d ecisive. Third, through mission  command, commanders enable subordinates 
to exercise initiative and act ind ependently. Controlling tempo  requires both audacity and patience. Audacity 
initiates the actions needed to develop a situation; patience a llows a situation to develop until the force can 
strike at the most crucial time and place. Ultimately, the goal  is maintaining a tempo appropriate to retaining 
and exploiting the initiative and  achieving the end state. 
Army forces expend more energy  and resources when operating at a high tempo. Commanders assess 
their force â€™s capacity to operate at a higher tempo based on its performanc e and available resources. An
effective operational design varies tempo throughout an operati on to increase endurance while maintaining 
appropriate speed and momentum. There is more to tempo than spe ed. While speed can be important, 
commanders vary speed to achieve endurance and optimize operati onal reach.
When considering tempo it is critical to consider the risks asso ciated with the requirement to 
consolidate gains. When forces consolidate gains throughout an operation, a commander may accept the risk 
of slower tempo in the near term, to ensure the enemy is unable  to protract the conflict with bypassed or 
irregular forces that avoid decisive engagement with friendly f orces. There may be circumstances when a 
commander accepts risk by deciding to consolidate gains in a la ter phase during operations because of a need 
Operational Art 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 2-9 to conduct operations at a higher tempo initially. Regardless o f where the commander accepts risk associated 
with tempo, the requirement to consolidate gains is inherent to  almost all operations on land. 
PHASING AND TRANSITIONS  
 A phase  is a planning and execution tool used to divide an operation i n duration or activity . A 
change in phase usually involves a change of mission, task orga nization, or rules of engagement. Phasing 
helps in planning and controlling, and it may be indicated by t ime, distance, terrain, or an event. The ability 
of Army forces to extend operations in time and space, coupled with a desire to dictate tempo, often presents 
commanders with more objectives and decisive points than the fo rce can engage simultaneously. This may 
require commanders and staffs t o consider sequencing operations .  
 Phasing is critical to arrangin g all tasks of an operation that  cannot be performed simultaneously. It 
describes how the commander envisions the overall operation unf olding. It is the logical expression of the 
commander â€™s visualization in time. Within a phase, a large portion of the  force executes similar or mutually 
supporting activities. Achieving a specified condition or set o f conditions typically marks the end of a phase.  
 Simultaneity, depth, and tempo are vital to all operations. How ever, forces cannot always attain them 
to the degree desired. In such cases, commanders limit the numb er of objectives and decisive points engaged 
simultaneously. They deliberately sequence certain actions to m aintain tempo while focusing combat power 
at a decisive point in time and space. Commanders employ a comb ination of simultaneous and sequential 
tasks at multiple echelons to establish end state conditions du ring an operation.  
 Phasing can extend operational reach. When a force lacks the ca pability to accomplish its mission in a 
single action, commanders phase t he operation. Each phase shoul d strive to â€”  
z Focus effort. 
z Concentrate combat power in time and space at a decisive point.   
z Accomplish its objectives deliberately and logically. 
 Transitions mark a change of focus between phases or between th e ongoing operation and execution 
of a branch or sequel. Shifting priorities among offensive, def ensive, stability, and DSCA tasks also involve 
transitions. Transitions requi re planning and preparation well before their execution, so the force can maintain 
the momentum and tempo of operations. The force is vulnerable d uring transitions, and commanders establish 
clear conditions for their execution.  
 A transition occurs for several reasons. Transitions occur when  delivering essential services, retaining 
infrastructure needed for reconstruction, or when consolidating  gains. (See paragraphs 3-28 through 3-38 for 
a discussion of consolidating gains.) An unexpected change in c onditions may require commanders to direct 
an abrupt transition between phases. In such cases, the overall  composition of the force remains unchanged 
despite sudden changes in mission, task organization, and rules  of engagement. Typically, task organization 
evolves to meet changing conditions; however, transition planni ng must also account for changes in mission. 
Commanders continuously assess the situation, and they task-org anize and cycle their forces to retain 
operational initiative. Commanders strive to achieve changes in  emphasis without incurring an operational 
pause.  
 Commanders identify potential transitions during planning and a ccount for them throughout execution. 
Considerations for identifying potential transitions should inc ludeâ€” 
z Forecasting in advance when and how to transition. 
z Arranging tasks to facilitate transitions. 
z Creating a task organization th at anticipates transitions. 
z Rehearsing certain transitions such as from defense to countera ttack or from offense to 
consolidating gains. 
z Ensuring the force understands the different rules of engagemen t during transitions. 
 Commanders should appreciate the time required to both plan for  and execute transitions. Assessment 
ensures that commanders measure progress toward such transition s and take appropriate actions to prepare 
for and execute them.  
Chapter 2 
2-10 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 CULMINATION
The culminating point is a point at which a force no longer has the capability to con tinue its form of 
operations, offense or defense (JP  5-0). Culmination represents  a crucial shift in relative combat power. It is 
relevant to both attackers and def enders at each level of warfa re. While conducting offensive operations, the 
culminating point occurs when a force cannot continue the attack  and must assume a defensive posture or 
execute an operational pause. While conducting a defense, it oc curs when a force can no longer defend itself 
and must withdraw or risk destruction. The culminating point is  more difficult to identify when Army forces 
perform stability tasks. Two conditions can result in culminatio n while performing stability tasks: units being 
too dispersed to achieve security and units lacking required re sources to achieve the end state. While 
performing DSCA tasks, culmination may occur if forces must respo nd to more catastrophic events than they 
can manage simultaneously. Such a situation results in culminat ion due to exhaustion. 
A culmination may be a planned event. In such cases, the concep t of operations predicts which part of 
a force will culminate, and the task organization includes addit ional forces to assume the mission after 
culmination. Typically, culmination is caused by direct combat actions or higher echelon resourcing 
decisions. Culmination relates to the force â€™s ability to generate and apply combat power, and it is not a la sting 
condition. To continue operations after culminating, commanders  may reinforce or reconstitute tactical units. 
OPERATIONAL REACH
Operational reach reflects the ability to achieve success throu gh a well-conceived operational 
approach, and it is applicable to A rmy forces operating as part o f the joint force. Operational reach is a tether; 
it is a function of intelligence, protection, sustainment, endu rance, and combat power relative to enemy
forces. The limit of a unit â€™s operational reach is its culmin ating point. Operational reach balances the natural 
tension among endurance, momentum, and protection. Commanders s eek to extend the operational reach far 
enough to accomplish their objectives before culmination. 
Endurance refers to the ability to employ combat power anywhere  for protracted periods. It stems from 
the ability to organize, protect, and sustain a force, regardle ss of the distance from its base and the austerity 
of the environment. Endurance involves anticipating requirement s and making the most effective and
efficient use of resources. Endurance contributes to Army force sâ€™ability to achieve decisive outcomes over 
time. 
Momentum comes from retaining operational initiative and execut ing high-tempo operations that 
overwhelm enemy resistance. Commanders control momentum by main taining focus and pressure. They set 
a tempo that prevents exhaustion and maintains adequate sustain ment. A sustainable tempo extends 
operational reach. Commanders ma intain momentum by anticipating  and transitioning rapidly between any 
combination of offensive, defensive, stability, or DSCA tasks. M omentum prevents an enemy from 
recovering the initiative. Sometimes commanders push the force to its culminating point to take maximum 
advantage of an opportunity. Exploitations and pursuits often i nvolve pushing all available forces to the limit 
of their endurance to capitalize on momentum and retain the ini tiative. 
Protection is an important contributor to operational reach. Co mmanders anticipate how enemy actions 
and environmental factors might disrupt operations and then det ermine the protection capabilities required 
to maintain sufficient reach. Protection closely relates to end urance and momentum. It also contributes to the 
commander â€™s ability to extend operations in time and space. The protectio n warfighting function helps 
commanders maintain their force â€™s integrity and combat power. 
Commanders and staffs consider operational reach to ensure Army  forces accomplish their missions 
before culminating. Commanders continually strive to extend ope rational reach. They assess friendly and 
enemy force status and civil considerations, anticipate culmina tion, consolidate gains, and plan operational 
pauses if necessary. The use of basing can sustain operational reach in time and space.
BASING
Army basing overseas typically falls into two general categorie s: permanent (bases or installations) 
and nonpermanent (base camps). A base is a locality from which operations are projected or supported 
(JP 4-0). Generally, bases are in host nations in which the Unite d States has a long-term lease and a 
Operational Art 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 2-11 status-of-forces agreement. A base camp is an evolving military facility that supports the military ope rations 
of a deployed unit and provides the necessary support and servi ces for sustained operations (ATP 3-37.10). 
Base camps are nonpermanent by design and designated as bases w hen the intention is to make them 
permanent. Bases or base camps may have a specific purpose (suc h as serving as an intermediate staging 
base, a logistics base, or a base camp) or they may be multifun ctional. The longer base camps exist, the more 
they exhibit many of the same characteristics as bases in terms  of the support and services provided and types 
of facilities developed. A base or base camp has a defined peri meter, has established access controls, and 
takes advantage of natural and man-made features.  
 Basing may be joint or single Service and will routinely suppor t both U.S. and multinational forces, as 
well as interagency partners, operating anywhere along the rang e of military operations. Commanders often 
designate an area as a base or base camp and assign responsibil ity to a single commander for protection and 
terrain management within the base. Within large echelon suppor t areas or joint security areas, controlling 
commanders may designate base clusters for mutual protection an d to exercise command and control. (See 
JP 4-0 for more information on joint logistics and basing and J P 3-10 for more on joint security areas.)  
 When a base camp expands to include clusters of sustainment, he adquarters, and other supporting units, 
its commander may designate it a support area. These areas of o perations facilitate the positioning, 
employment, and protection of resources required to sustain, en able, and control tactical operations. Army 
forces typically rely on a mix of bases and base camps to serve  as intermediate staging bases, lodgments 
(subsequently developed into base camps or potentially bases), and forward operating bases. These bases and 
base camps deploy and employ landpower simultaneously to operat ional depth. They establish and maintain 
strategic reach for deploying forces and ensure sufficient oper ational reach to extend operations in time and 
space. (See paragraph 4-29 for a discussion of support areas.)  
 An intermediate staging base  is a tailorable, temporary location used for staging forces, s ustainment 
and/or extraction into and out o f an operational area (JP 3-35) . At an intermediate staging base, units are 
unloaded from intertheater lift, reassembled and integrated wit h their equipment, and then moved by 
intratheater lift into the area of operations. The theater army  commander provides extensive support to Army 
forces transiting the base. The combatant commander may designa te the theater army commander to 
command the base or provide a  headquarters suitable for the tas k. Intermediate staging bases are established 
near, but normally not in, the joint operations area. They ofte n are located in the supported combatant 
commander â€™s area of responsibility. For land forces, intermediate staging  bases may be located in the area of 
operations. However, if possible,  they are established outside the range of direct and most indirect enemy 
fire systems and beyond the enemy â€™s political sphere of influence.  
 A base camp that expands to incl ude an airfield may become a fo rward operating base. A forward 
operating base  is an airfield used to support tactical operations without est ablishing full support facilities 
(JP 3-09.3). Forward operating bases may be used for an extende d time and are often critical to security. 
During protracted operations, they may be further expanded and improved to establish a more permanent 
presence. The scale and complexity of a forward operating base,  however, directly relate to the size of the 
force required to maintain it. A large forward operating base w ith extensive facilities requires a much larger 
security force than a smaller, austere base. Commanders weigh w hether to expand and improve a forward 
operating base against the type and number of forces available to secure it, the expected length of the forward 
deployment, the force â€™s sustainment requirements, and the enemy threat.  
 A lodgment  is a designated area in a hostile or potentially hostile opera tional area that, when seized 
and held, makes the continuous landing of troops and materiel p ossible and provides maneuver space for 
subsequent operations (JP 3-18). Identifying and preparing the initial lodgment significantly influences the 
conduct of an operation. Lodgments should expand to allow easy access to strategic sealift and airlift, offer 
adequate space for storage, fac ilitate transshipment of supplie s and equipment, and be accessible to multiple 
lines of communications. Typically, deploying forces establish lodgments near key points of entry in the 
operational area that offer cent ral access to air , land, and se a transportation hubs.  
RISK  
 Risk is the probability and severity of loss linked to hazards.  Risk, uncertainty, and chance are inherent 
in all military operations. When commanders accept risk, they c reate opportunities to seize, retain, and exploit 
Chapter 2 
2-12 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 operational initiative and achieve decisive results. The willin gness to incur risk is often the key to exposing 
enemy weaknesses that an enemy considers beyond friendly reach.  Understanding risk requires accurate 
running estimates and valid assumptions. Embracing risk as oppo rtunity requires situational awareness and 
imagination, as well as audacity. Successful commanders assess and mitigate risk continuously throughout 
the operations process.  
Inadequate planning and preparation puts forces at risk, as doe s delaying action while waiting for 
perfect intelligence and synchronization. Risk averse commander s and units miss fleeting opportunities, 
which can actually increase the risk of greater casualties. Reas onably estimating and intentionally accepting 
risk is fundamental to conducting successful operations and ess ential to the mission command approach. 
Experienced commanders balance audacity and imagination against  risk and uncertainty to strike at a time, 
at a place, and in a manner unexp ected by enemy forces. This is  the essence of surprise. 
Commanders accept risks to crea te and maintain conditions neces sary to seize, retain, and exploit the 
initiative. A good operational approach considers the balances of risk and uncertainty with friction and 
chance. Plans and or ders should provide the flexibility subordi nates need take initiative when opportunities 
present themselves or conditions change as a hedge against risk . Plans and orders that have no tolerances for 
friction or deviation from how tas ks might be accomplished are inherently higher risk than those that do.

The Armyâ€™s Operational Concept 
This chapter discusses the Armyâ€™s operational concept of unifie d land operations. It 
discusses the principles and tenets of unified land operations and decisive action. 
UNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS 
3-1. Unified land operations is the Army â€™s warfighting doctrine, and it is the Army â€™s operational concept
and contribution to unified action. Unified land operations is an intellectual outgrowth of both previous
operations doctrine and recent c ombat experience. It recognizes  the nature of modern warfare in multiple
domains and the need to conduct a fluid mix of offensive, defen sive, and stability operations or DSCA
simultaneously. Unified land operations acknowledges that strat egic success requires fully integrating U.S.
military operations with the efforts of interagency and multina tional partners. Army forces, as part of the
joint force, contribute to joint operations through the conduct  of unified land operations. Unified land
operations is the simultaneous execution of  offense, defense, stability, a nd defense support of civil
authorities across multiple domains to shape operational enviro nments, prevent conflict, prevail in
large-scale ground combat, and c onsolidate gains as part of uni fied action .
3-2. The goal of unified land operations is to establish conditi ons that achieve the JFC â€™s end state by
applying landpower as part of a unified action to defeat the en emy. Unified land operations is how the Army
applies combat power through 1) simultaneous offensive, defensi ve, and stability, or DSCA, to 2) seize,
retain, and exploit the initiative, and 3) consolidate gains. M ilitary forces seek to prevent or deter threats
through unified action, and, when  necessary, defeat aggression.
DECISIVE ACTION 
3-3. Decisive action  is the continuous, simultaneous  execution of offensive, defens ive, and stability
operations or defense support of civil authority tasks . Army forces conduct decisive action. Commanders
seize, retain, and exploit the initiative while synchronizing t heir actions to achieve the best effects possible.
Operations conducted outside the  United States and its territor ies simultaneously combine three elements of
decisive action â€”offense, defense, and stability. Within the United States and i ts territories, decisive action
combines elements of DSCA and, as required, offense and defense  to support homeland defense. (See table
3-1 on page 3-2.)
3-4. Decisive action begins with the commander â€™s intent and concept of operations. Decisive action
provides direction for an entire operation. Commanders and staf fs refine the concept of operations during
planning and determine the proper allocation of resources and t asks. Throughout an operation, they may
adjust the allocation of resources and tasks as conditions chan ge.
3-5. The simultaneity of decisive action varies by echelon and s pan of control. Higher echelons generally
have a broader focus than lower echelons when assigning respons ibilities to subordinates. The higher the
echelon, the greater the possi bility that all elements of decis ive action occur simultaneously within its area
of operations. At lower echelons, an assigned task may require all the echelons â€™ combat power to execute a
specific task. For example, in some form a higher echelon, such  as a corps, always performs offensive,
defensive, and stability or defense support of civil authority operations simultaneously. Subordinate brigades
perform some combination of offensive, defensive, and stability  operations, but they generally are more
focused by their immediate priorities on a specific element, pa rticularly during large-scale ground combat
operations.

3-6. Unified land operations addresses combat with armed opponen ts amid populations. This requires Army
forces to shape civil conditions. Winning battles and engagemen ts is important, but it is not always the most
significant task in a strategic context. Shaping civil conditio ns with unified action partners is generally
important to the success of all campaigns, and thus it is a cri tical component of all operations.
3-7. Unified land operations span the entire competition continu um. They are conducted to support all four
Army strategic roles. The relative emphasis on the various elem ents of decisive action vary with the purpose
and context of the operations being conducted. (See figure 3-1. )
The Armyâ€™s Operational Concept  
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 3-3 Figure 3-1. Decisive action  
3-8. There are enabling operations that are common to all elements o f decisive action. Examples of enabling 
operations are relief in place, security operations, and troop movement. (For more information about enabling 
operations, see ADP 3-90.) 
3-9. Historical experience demonstrates that forces trained exclusiv ely for offensive and defensive 
operations are not fully proficient at stability operations. Li kewise, forces involved in protracted stability 
operations or DSCA require intensive training to regain profici ency in offensive or defensive operations 
before engaging in large-scale ground combat operations. While there is inherent risk in either situation, there 
is greater risk to the force when it is required to conduct off ensive and defensive operations for which it is 
not proficient. Commanders resolve the tension inherent in the different training requirements by setting 
priorities for individual, co llective, and unit mission-essenti al tasks based upon higher echelon guidance and 
what their units are most likely to be tasked to do.  
THE PURPOSE OF SIMULTANEITY  
3-10.  Simultaneity is the act of doing multiple things at the same ti me. The purpose of simultaneity during 
decisive action is to create multiple dilemmas that overwhelm a n adversary or enemy â€™s ability to effectively 
respond. Multiple dilemmas can create a cascading effect that l eaves an opponent with no good options to 
accomplish its objectives. Achieving simultaneity requires the ability to conduct operations in depth and to 
integrate them so that their timing multiplies their effectiven ess across multiple domains throughout an area 
of operations. Commanders must c onsider their entire area of op erations, enemy forces, and information 
collection activities as they synchronize combat power to condu ct simultaneous operations that immobilize, 
suppress, or surprise enemy forces. Such actions nullify an ene my force â€™s ability to react in a coordinated, 
mutually supporting fashion.  
3-11.  Army forces create depth in time and space through combined arm s, economy of force, continuous 
reconnaissance, and joint capabilities. Conducting operations a cross large areas forces an adversary or enemy 
to react in multiple directions and opens up opportunities that  can be further exploited to create additional 
dilemmas.  
Offensive Operations 
3-12.  An offensive operation  is an operation to defeat or destroy enemy forces and gain con trol of 
terrain, resources, and population centers.  Offensive operations impose the commander â€™s will on an 

Chapter 3 
3-4 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 enemy. The offense is the most direct means of seizing, retaini ng, and exploiting the initiative to gain a 
physical and psychological advantag e. In the offense, the decis ive operation is a sudden action directed 
toward enemy weaknesses and capitalizing on speed, surprise, an d shock. If that operation fails to destroy an
enemy, operations continue until enemy forces are defeated. The  offense compels an enemy to react, creating 
new or larger weaknesses the attacking force can exploit. (See ADP 3-90 for a detailed discussion of the 
offense.)  
Defensive Operations 
3-13. A defensive operation  is an operation to defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economiz e forces, and
develop conditions favorable for offensive or stability operati ons. Normally the defense cannot achieve a
decisive victory. However, it sets conditions for a counteroffe nsive or a counterattack that enables forces to
regain the initiative. Defensive operations are a counter to an  enemy offensive action, and they seek to destroy
as much of the attacking enemy forces as possible. They preserv e control over land, resources, and
populations, and retain key terrain, protect lines of communica tions, and protect critical capabilities against
attack. Commanders can conduct defensive operations in one area  to free forces for offensive operations
elsewhere. (See ADP 3-90 for a detailed discussion of the defen se.)
Stability Operations 
3-14. A stability operation  is an operation conducted outside the United States in coordin ation with
other instruments of national power to establish or maintain a secure environment and provide
essential governmental services, e mergency infrastructure recon struction, and humanitarian relief .
These operations support governance by a host nation, an interi m government, or a military government.
Stability involves coercive and constructive action. Stability helps in building relationships among unified
action partners and promoting U.S. security interests. It can h elp establish politica l, legal, social, and
economic institutions in an area while supporting transition of  responsibility to a legitimate authority.
Commanders are legally required to perform minimum-essential st ability operations tasks when controlling
populated areas of operations. These include security, food, wa ter, shelter, and medical treatment. (See
ADP 3-07 for a detailed discussion of stability.)
Defense Support of Civil Authorities 
3-15. Defense support of civil authorities  is support provided by U.S. Federal military forces, DOD civil ians,
DOD contract personnel, DOD Component assets, and National Guar d forces (when the Secretary of
Defense, in coordination with the Governors of the affected Sta tes, elects and requests to use those forces in
Title 32, United States Code status) in response to requests fo r assistance from civil authorities for domestic
emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activi ties, or from qualifying entities for special
events. (DODD 3025.18). DSCA is a task executed in the homeland  and U.S. territories. It is performed to
support another primary agency, lead federal agency, or local a uthority. When DSCA is authorized, it consists
of four types of operations (see table 3-1 on page 3-2 and DODD  3025.18). National Guard forces â€”Title 32
or state active forces under the command and control of the gov ernor and the adjutant general â€”are usually
the first forces to respond on  behalf of state authorities. Whe n Federal military forces are employed for DSCA
activities, they remain under Federal military command and cont rol at all times. (See DODD 3025.18,
JP 3-28, and ADP 3-28 for detailed discussions of DSCA.)
HOMELAND DEFENSE AND DECISIVE ACTION
3-16. Homeland defense  is the protection of United States sovereignty, territory, dom estic population, and
critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression  or other threats as directed by the President
(JP 3-27). The DOD has lead responsibility for homeland defense . The strategy for homeland defense (and
DSCA) calls for defending U.S. territory against attack by stat e and nonstate actors through an active, layered
defense that aims to deter and defeat aggression abroad and sim ultaneously protect the homeland. The Army
supports this strategy with capabilities in forward regions of the world, geographic approaches to U.S.
territory, and within the U.S. homeland.
3-17. During homeland defense, Army forces work closely with fed eral, state, territorial, tribal, local, and
private agencies. Land domain homeland defense could consist of  offense and defense as part of decisive
The Armyâ€™s Operational Concept  
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 3-5 action. Homeland defense is a defense-in-depth that relies on c ollection, analysis, and sharing of information 
and intelligence; strategic and regional deterrence; military p resence in forward regions; and the ability to 
rapidly obtain and project warfighting capabilities to defend t he United States, its allies, and its interests. 
This defense may include support to civil law enforcement; anti terrorism and force protection; counterdrug; 
air and missile defense; chemical, biological, radiological, nu clear, and high-yield explosives; and defensive 
cyberspace operations. It can als o include security cooperation  with other partners to build an integrated and 
mutually supportive concept of protection.  
TRANSITIONING IN DECISIVE ACTION  
3-18.  Conducting decisive action involves more than simultaneous exec ution. Commanders and staffs must 
consider their units â€™ capabilities and capacities relative to each element of decisi ve action. Commanders 
consider and balance the elements while preparing their command erâ€™s intent and concept of operations. They 
determine which elements to accomplish simultaneously and which  require phasing, whether additional 
resources are necessary, and how  to transition emphasis from on e to another.  
3-19.  Transitions in emphasis between t he elements of decisive action  require careful assessment, planning, 
and unit preparation. Commanders first assess a situation to de termine applicable elements and the priority 
for each. When an operation is phased, the plan includes these changes. The relative weight given to each 
element varies with conditions. This weight is reflected in tas ks assigned to subordinates, resource allocation, 
and task organization.  
3-20.  Unanticipated changes or an improved understanding of an operat ional environment may result in 
commanders reframing a problem and adapting an operation. Unfor eseen success resulting in collapse of 
enemy opposition illustrates one unanticipated change. Another example is a deteriorating situation during 
peace operations requiring a transition to the defense or offen se to reestablish stability. Commanders need to 
adjust task organizations to support the requirements of transi tions. When transitioning, subordinate 
commanders must clearly understand their higher echelon command erâ€™s intent, concept of operations, and 
desired end state. This includes h ow much risk to accept, and w here to accept it.  
CONSOLIDATE GAINS  
3-21.  The Army strategic role of consolidate gains sets conditions fo r enduring political and strategic 
outcomes to military operations. Army forces provide most of th e capabilities the JFC requires to consolidate 
gains at scale during a campaign. Army and unified action partn er forces exploit tactical and operational 
success for the JFC as they consolidate gains to set security c onditions for the desired political end state. 
Activities to consolidate gains are an integral part of winning  across the competition continuum and range of 
military operations, and they require consideration through all  phases of an operation. Determining when and 
how to consolidate gains at the operational level, and applying  the necessary resources at the tactical level to 
do so effectively, requires clear understanding about where to accept risk during an operation. Failure to 
consolidate gains generally lead s to failure in achieving the d esired end state, since it would represent a 
failure to follow-through on  initial tactical successes and ced es the initiative to determined enemies seeking 
to prolong a conflict. The creatio n of governable space is nece ssary for transition of responsibility to a 
legitimate authority and the successful completion of combat op erations. Army forces integrate the efforts of 
all unified action partners as they consolidate gains.  
3-22.  Army forces consolidate gains through decisive action, executin g offense, defense, and stability to 
defeat enemy forces in detail and set security conditions requi red for a desired end state. Consolidate gains 
is not a phase. Army forces consolidate gains continuously duri ng the conduct of operations, although not 
simultaneously and with varying purposes by echelons over time.  Consolidating gains is focused on the 
exploitation of tactical success to ensure enemy forces cannot reconstitute any form of resistance in areas 
where they were initially defeated. This creates an enabling te mpo of operations on the ground in the close, 
deep, and support areas. (See table 3-2 on page 3-6 for a gener al taxonomy of purpose that reflects focus, 
planning considerations, and approach by echelons as they conso lidate gains during combat.)  
3-23.  At the strategic-operational level the highest tactical echelon s plan and coordin ate the resources 
necessary to achieve the JFC â€™s desired end state. They also p rovide subordinate echelons a s hared 
visualization of the security conditions necessary for the desi red political or strategic end state. Achieving 
Chapter 3 
3-6 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 the desired end state generally requires a whole of government effort with unified action partners in and out 
of the theater of operations. At the operational-tactical level , field armies and corps exploit division tactical 
success through decisive action by maintaining contact with ene my remnants, bypassed forces, and the 
capabilities that enemy forces could militarize to protract the  conflict. Friendly forces employ lethal and 
non-lethal capabilities to defeat remaining enemy forces in det ail and reduce the will of those forces and the 
local population to resist. Divisions consolidate gains through  decisive action focused on the defeat of 
bypassed forces and security between the close area and divisio n rear boundary to maintain freedom of 
movement and the tempo of the operations.  
Table 3-2. Consolidate gains by echelon 
Echelon Tasks to Consolidate Gains
Strategic-operational level (joint force land 
component commander â€”corps)Establishing the security conditions necessary to 
achieve the desired political end state.
Operational-tactical level (field army â€”corps) Exploiting tactical success to ensure the enemy 
cannot mount protracted resistance by other 
means.
Tactical level (corps â€”division) Maintaining tempo and ensuring the enemy enjoys 
no respite; defeating the enemy in detail.
3-24. Consolidate gains is integral to the conclusion of all mil itary operations, and it requires deliberate
planning, preparation and resource s to ensure sustainable succe ss. This planning should ensure U.S. forces
operate in a way that actively facilitates achievement of the d esired post-hostilities end state and transition to
legitimate authorities. Planners should anticipate task organiz ation changes as conditions on the ground
change over time, based on mission and operational variables. F or example, additional engineer, military
police, civil affairs, psychological operations, and sustainmen t capabilities are typically required to support
the security and stability of large areas as they stabilize ove r time. In some instances, Army forces will be in
charge of integrating and synchronizing these activities, in ot hers Army forces will be in support. However,
by backwards planning from the end state, and prioritizing the transition to legitimate authority, rather than
simply planning from deployment of forces to the quick and effi cient defeat of the enemy, commanders
facilitate long-term success, lim it mission creep, and minimize  post-conflict problems.
ACTIVITIES TO CONSOLIDATE GAINS 
3-25. To consolidate gains, Army fo rces take specific actions. T hese actions are described in paragraphs
3-26 through 3-36.
3-26. Army forces conduct a combination of offensive, defensive,  and stability operations appropriate for
their areas of operations. During combat, units consolidate gai ns in their areas of operations once large-scale
ground combat has concluded in their area. Their initial focus is the defeat of all remaining enemy forces in
detail and controlling all that could constitute a means for fu rther resistance. This may require offensive
action to defeat bypassed enemy units and secure enemy personne l, bases, equipment, and ammunition. It
also requires an accurate understanding of enemy orders of batt le and the capabilities that must be accounted
for. As units establish area security, the balance of tasks sho uld shift more heavily towards stability tasks
focused on the control of populations and key nodes.
3-27. Area security is necessary to consolidate gains. Forces pe rform security tasks to protect friendly forces,
routes, and critical infrastructure. Forces secure and control populations and enable freedom of friendly action
within their area of operations.
3-28. Forces first perform minimum-essential stability operation s tasks, then they establish a safe and secure
environment to provide essential governmental services, emergen cy infrastructure reconstruction, and
humanitarian relief. Maneuver forces may require significant au gmentation to their task organization to
perform stability tasks effectively.
3-29. Commanders ensure sufficient combat power is positioned wi thin their area of operations to prevent
counterattacks or infiltration of forces that could disrupt ong oing efforts to consolidate gains. These actions
are especially important during operations intended to re-estab lish the international border for a friendly state,
and they may be heavily weighted towards the defense.
The Armyâ€™s Operational Concept  
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 3-7 3-30.  Forces employ civil-military operations within their capabiliti es until they are augmented with civil 
affairs capabilities. The focus is to ensure minimal interferen ce with friendly operations. 
3-31.  Forces employ information-related capabilities to influence the  behavior of enemy forces. They also 
employ information-related capabilities with the local populati on in ways beneficial to achieve the desired 
end state. 
3-32.  Army forces consolidate gains th rough decisive action, initiall y weighted towards offensive operations 
against bypassed enemy forces and remnants of defeated enemy fo rces. They consolidate gains to ensure the 
area security essential to units operating in support areas to maintain offensive tempo. Doing so requires 
planning for additional forces s o that commanders are not force d to shift combat power away from the close 
and deep areas. Maintaining offensive tempo requires additional  combat power to conduct detention 
operations, relocate displaced civilians, establish law and ord er, provide humanitarian assistance, and secure 
key infrastructure. Ending enemy resistance and denying enemy f orces the respite necessary to constitute a 
new form of resistance that prolongs the conflict are critical to success.  
3-33.  Commanders establish and sustain security during transitions be tween phases of operations to ensure 
there are minimal seams or gaps that allow enemy forces time to  reorganize. Army forces perform continuous 
reconnaissance to gain or maintain contact with remaining enemy  forces to enable their defeat and retain the 
initiative. Accounting for all enemy forces and their supporter s helps determine the level of risk within their 
area of operations as well as the prioritization of tasks they assign subordinates. Commanders ensure that 
forces are properly task organized for the tasks they assign. C apabilities such as military information support 
operations, public affairs, and com bat camera help in this effo rt.  
3-34.  Army forces are responsible for the provision of minimum-essent ial stability operations tasks. 
Generally these stability tasks include providing security, foo d, water, and medical treatment. However, 
Army forces may not perform all the essential tasks if another organization exists that can adequately perform 
those tasks. Army forces execute a greater number of stability tasks as requirements and capabilities evolve. 
The military retains the lead to establish civil security throu gh the performance of security force assistance 
in all cases. The lead for the other all tasks eventually trans fers to another military or civilian organization, 
although Army forces may retain a supporting role. (For more in formation on stability tasks, see ADP 3-07.)  
3-35.  Army forces must analyze the local capability and capacity to p rovide services as well as determine 
the ability of other U.S. government agencies, international ag encies, NGOs, and contractors to provide 
support. The goal is to transition responsibility for humanitar ian issues to entities other than Army forces as 
quickly as possible. This requires prior planning and coordinat ion.  
3-36.  Consolidate gains may occur over a significant period and invol ve several changes in focus and 
emphasis as conditions change. An initial emphasis on defeating  threat conventional forces will shift to more 
broadly based area security of populations and infrastructure. Eventually the emphasis and focus changes to 
meeting the needs of the population, influencing their percepti ons, and allowing for a transition to a legitimate 
authority. Transitions are not g enerally abrupt, and units will  manage different stability and security tasks 
concurrently until operations are complete. All activities shou ld be prioritized towards securing and 
stabilizing the AO to meet the conditions necessary to achieve the desired conflict end state. 
PRINCIPLES OF UNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS  
3-37.  A principle  is a comprehensive and fundamental rule or an assumption of ce ntral importance that 
guides how an organization or function approaches and thinks ab out the conduct of operations (ADP 1-01). 
By integrating the six principles of unified land operations â€”mission command, develop the situation through 
action, combined arms, adherence to the law of war, establish a nd maintain security, and create multiple 
dilemmas for the enemy â€”Army commanders increase the probability of operational and str ategic success. 
Success requires fully integr ating U.S. military operations wit h the efforts of unified action partners. Success 
also requires commanders to exercise disciplined initiative to rapidly exploit opportunities that favorably 
develop the situation through action and create multiple dilemm as for the enemy.  
Chapter 3 
3-8 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 MISSION COMMAND
3-38. The Army â€™s command and control doctrine supports its operations doctrine . Command and control  is
the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designate d commander over assigned and attached forces
in the accomplishment of the mission (JP 1). Command and contro l is fundamental to the art and science of
warfare. No single specialized military function, either by its elf  or com bin ed w ith  oth ers , h as a pu rpos e
without it. Through command and control, commanders provide pur pose and direction to integrate all military
activities towards a common goal â€”mission accomplishment.
3-39. Mission command is the Army's approach to command and control that empowers sub ordinate decision
making and decentralized execution appropriate to the situation  (ADP 6-0). Mission command enables the
Army â€™s operational concept of unified  land operations and its emphas is on seizing, retaining, and exploiting
the initiative. Mission command has seven fundamental principle s:
zCompetence.
zTrust.
zShared understanding.
zCommander â€™s intent.
zMission orders.
zDisciplined initiative.
zRisk acceptance.
(See ADP 6-0 for a detailed discussion of the fundamental princ iples of mission command.) 
3-40. The mission command approach to command and control is bas ed on the Army â€™s view that war is
inherently chaotic and uncertain. No plan can account for every  possibility, and most plans must change
rapidly during execution to account for changes in the situatio n. No single person is ever sufficiently informed
to make every important decision , nor can a single person keep up with the number of decisions that need to
be made during combat. Enemy forces may behave differently than  expected, a route may become
impassable, or units could consume supplies at unexpected rates . Friction and unforeseeable combinations of
variables impose uncertainty in all operations and demand an ap proach that does not attempt to impose
perfect order, but rather accep ts uncertainty and makes allowan ces for unpredictability.
3-41. Mission command helps comma nders capitalize on subordinate  ingenuity, innovation, and decision
making to achieve the commander â€™s intent when conditions change or current orders are no longer  relevant.
It requires subordinates who seek opportunities and commanders who accept risk for subordinates trying to
meet their intent. Subordinate decision making and decentralize d execution appropriate to the situation help
manage uncertainty and enable necessary tempo at each echelon d uring operations.
3-42. Subordinates empowered to make decisions during operations  unburden higher echelon commanders
from issues that distract from necessary broader perspective an d focus on critical issues. Mission command
allows those commanders with the best situational understanding  to make rapid decisions without waiting
for higher echelon commanders to a ssess the situation and issue  orders.
3-43. Decentralized execution is the delegation of decision maki ng authority to subordinates, so they may
make and implement decisions and adjust their assigned tasks in  fluid and rapidly changing situations.
Subordinate decisions should be ethically based, and within the  framework of their higher echelon
commander â€™s intent. Decentralized execution is essential to seizing, reta ining, and exploiting the initiative
during operations in environments where conditions rapidly chan ge and uncertainty is the norm. Rapidly
changing situations and uncertainty are inherent in operations where commanders seek to establish a tempo
and intensity that enemy forces cannot match.
3-44. Commanders determine the appropriate level of control, inc luding delegating decisions and
determining how much decentralized execution to employ. The lev el and application of control is constantly
evolving and must be continuously assessed and adjusted to ensu re the level of control is appropriate to the
situation. Commanders should allow subordinates the greatest fr eedom of action commensurate with the level
of acceptable risk in a particular situation.
3-45. Different operations and pha ses of operations may require tighter or more relaxed control over
subordinate elements than others.  Operations that require the c lose synchronization of multiple units, or the
The Arm yâ€™s Operational Concept  
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 3-9 integration of effects in a limited amount of time, naturally r equire more detailed coordination, and may be 
controlled in a more centralized manner. Examples of this inclu de combined arms breaches, air assaults, and 
wet gap crossings. Conversely, operations that do not require t he close coordination of multiple units, such 
as a movement to contact or a pursuit, offer many opportunities  to exercise initiative. These opportunities 
may be lost if too much emphasis is placed on detailed synchron ization. Even in a highly controlled operation, 
subordinates must still exercise initiative to address unexpect ed problems and achieve their commander â€™s 
intent when existing orders no longer make sense in the context  of execution. 
DEVELOP THE SITUATION THROUGH ACTION  
3-46.  During operations, commanders develop the situation through act ion. Developing the situation requires 
information. Commanders fight for information while in contact with enemy forces and gather information 
through close association with a population. Developing the sit uation through action to collect information 
is inherently part of displaying disciplined initiative. Comman ders enhance situational awareness and 
understanding by assigning information collection tasks (reconn aissance, surveillance, security operations, 
and intelligence operations) to  collect information requirement s.  
3-47.  Often information can only be provided by close combat that for ces enemy forces to reveal their 
capabilities, locations, and intent. When units encounter an en emy force or obstacle, then they must quickly 
determine the nature of the threat they face. Units share the e nemy â€™s dispositions, activities, and movements, 
along with an assessment, to their higher echelon headquarters and with the other units in their formation.  
3-48.  During planning, commanders identify information gaps, develop information requirements, and then 
assign collection tasks to subordinates. Information collection  and analysis allows staffs to develop options 
for the commander who uses them to further seize opportunities and maintain initiative.  
3-49.  Commanders take enemy capabilities and reaction times into acco unt when making decisions. They 
ensure that plans delegate decision-making authority to the low est echelon possible to obtain faster and more 
suitable decisions. Subordinates use their initiative to furthe r their higher echelon commander â€™s intent.  
3-50.  During execution, commanders make decisions quickly, usually wi th incomplete information. 
Commanders who can make and implement decisions faster than ene my commanders, even to a small degree, 
gain an accruing advantage that becomes significant over time. Commanders should not delay a decision in 
hopes of finding a perfect solution to a military problem. By t he time the slower com mander decides and 
acts, the faster one has already altered the tactical situation , making the slower one â€™s actions less effective or 
irrelevant. The faster commander maintains the initiative and d ictates the tempo of operations.  
3-51.  To make timely decisions, comman ders must understand the effect s of their decisions in the context of 
their operational environment. They must understand enemy capab ilities, the terrain and weather, and their 
impact on operations. Understanding an operational environment includes civil considerations â€”such as the 
population (with demographics and culture), the government, eco nomics, NGOs, and history.  
COMBINED ARMS  
3-52.  Combined arms  is the synchronized and simultaneous application of arms to ac hieve an effect 
greater than if each element was used separately or sequentiall y. Combined arms integrates leadership, 
information, and each of the warfighting functions and joint ca pabilities through mission command. Used 
destructively, combined arms integrates different capabilities so that counteracting one makes the enemy 
vulnerable to another. Used constructively, combined arms uses all assets available to multiply the 
effectiveness and efficiency of Army capabilities used in stabi lity or DSCA.  
3-53.  Combined arms uses the capabilities of all Army, joint, and mul tinational weapons systems â€”in the 
air, land, maritime, spac e, and cyberspace domains â€”in complementary and reinforcing ways. 
Complementary capabilities protect the weaknesses of one system  or organization with the capabilities of a 
different one. During maneuver, the fires warfighting function complements the movement and maneuver 
warfighting function. Ground maneuver can make enemy forces vul nerable to joint weapon systems, while 
joint capabilities can enable maneuver. Electronic warfare capa bilities can prevent enemy forces from 
communicating or relaying information about friendly maneuver. Information obtained from NGOs can 
facilitate effective distributi on of supplies during humanitari an assistance and disaster relief operations.  
Chapter 3 
3-10 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 3-54. Reinforcing capabilities combine similar systems or capabi lities in the same warfighting function to
increase the function â€™s overall capabilities. In urban operations, for example, infan try, aviation, and armor
units (movement and maneuver elements) working closely together  reinforce the protection, maneuver, and
direct fire capabilities of each unit type while creating casca ding dilemmas for enemy forces. The infantry
protects tanks from enemy infantry and antitank systems, while tanks provide protection and firepower for
the infantry. Attack helicopters maneuver above buildings to pr otect ground formations, while other aircraft
help sustain, extract, or air assault ground forces. Army artil lery can be reinforced by close air support, air
interdiction, air defense, and naval surface fire support, grea tly increasing both the mass and range of fires
available.
ADHERENCE TO THE LAW OF WAR
3-55. The law of war  is that part of international law that regulates the conduct o f armed hostilities (JP 1-04).
The law of war â€™s evolution was largely humanitarian and designed to reduce the  evils of war. The main
purposes of the law of war are to â€”
zProtect combatants, noncombatants, and civilians from unnecessa ry suffering.
zProvide certain fundamental pr otections for persons who fall in to the hands of the enemy,
particularly prisoners of war, civilians, and military wounded,  sick, and shipwrecked.
zFacilitate the restoration of peace.
zHelp military commanders in ensur ing the disciplined and effici ent use of military force.
zPreserve the professionalism and humanity of combatants.
3-56. Soldiers consider five important principles that govern th e law of war when planning and executing
operations: military necessity, humanity, distinction, proporti onality, and honor. Three interdependent
principles â€”military necessity, humanity, and honor â€”provide the foundation for other law of war
principles â€”such as proportionality and distinction. Law of war principles work as interdependent and
reinforcing parts of a coherent system. Military necessity just ifies certain actions necessary to defeat enemy
forces as quickly and efficiently as possible. Humanity forbids  actions that cause unnecessary suffering.
Proportionality requires that even when actions may be justifie d by military necessity, such actions may not
be unreasonable or excessive. Distinction underpins the parties â€™ responsibility to distinguish between the
armed forces and the civilian population. Lastly, honor support s the entire system and gives parties
confidence in it.
3-57. Rules of engagement  are directives issued by competent military authority that del ineate the
circumstances and limitations under which United States forces will initiate and/or continue combat
engagement with other forces encountered (JP 1-04). Rules of en gagement always recognize the inherent
right of self-defense. These rules vary between operations and types of units in the same area of operations,
and may change during an operation. Adherence to them ensures S oldiers act consistently with international
law, national policy, and military regulations.
3-58. Soldiers deployed to a combat zone overseas follow rules o f engagement established by the Secretary
of Defense and adjusted for theater conditions by the JFC. With in the United States and its territories, Soldiers
adhere to rules for the use of force. Rules for the use of forc e consist of directives issued to guide U.S. forces
during various operations. These directives may take the form o f execute orders, deployment orders,
memoranda of agreement, or plans. (See JP 3-28 for discussion o n rules for the use of force.) Rules of
engagement are permissive measures intended to allow the maximu m use of destructive combat power
appropriate for a mission. Rules for the use of force are restr ictive measures intended to allow only the
minimum force necessary to accomplish a mission. The underlying  principle is a continuum of force, a
carefully graduated level of respo nse determined by the behavio r of possible threats.
3-59. Successful operations require Army forces to employ lethal  and nonlethal capabilities in a disciplined
manner. Threats challenge the morals and ethics of Soldiers. Of ten an enemy does not respect international
laws or conventions and commits atrocities simply to provoke re taliation in kind. Any loss of discipline on
the part of friendly forces is likely to be distorted and explo ited into propaganda, and magnified through the
media. It is crucial that all personnel operate within applicab le U.S., international, and in some cases
host-nation laws and regulations. Ensuring friendly forces rema in within legal, moral, and ethical boundaries
is a leadership duty. This challenge rests heavily on small-uni t and company-grade leaders charged with
The Armyâ€™s Operational Concept  
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 3-11 maintaining good order and discipline within their respective u nits. The Soldier â€™s Rules in AR 350-1 distill 
the essence of the law of war. (See table 3-3 for a list of the  Soldier â€™s Rules.)  
Table 3-3. The Soldier â€™s Rules 
x Soldiers fight only enemy combatants. 
x Soldiers do not harm enemies who surrender. They disarm them an d turn them 
over to their superior. 
x Soldiers do not kill or torture any personnel in their custody . 
x Soldiers collect and care for the wounded, whether friend or f oe. 
x Soldiers do not attack medical personnel, facilities, or equip ment. 
x Soldiers destroy no more than the mission requires. 
x Soldiers treat civilians humanely. 
x Soldiers do not steal. Soldiers respect private property and p ossessions. 
x Soldiers should do their best to prevent violations of the law  of war. 
x Soldiers report all violations of the law of war to their supe rior. 
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN SECURITY  
3-60.  Army forces perform area security to ensure freedom of action a nd to deny enemy forces the ability to 
disrupt operations. Commanders combine reconnaissance tasks and  offensive, defensive, and stability 
operations to protect friendly forces, populations, infrastruct ure, and activities critical to mission 
accomplishment. Army forces integrate with partner military, la w enforcement, and civil capabilities to 
establish and maintain security. The Army â€™s ability to establish control is critical to consolidating gai ns in 
the wake of successful military operations.  
3-61.  Security operations prevent surprise, reduce uncertainty, and p rovide early warning of enemy 
activities. Warning provides friendly forces with time and mane uver space with which to react and develop 
the situation on favorable terms. Security operations prevent e nemies from discovering the friendly plan and 
protect the force from unforeseen enemy actions. Security eleme nts focus on preventing enemy forces from 
gathering essential elements of friendly information. Security is a dynamic effort that anticipates and thwarts 
enemy collection efforts. When successful, security operations allow the force to maintain the initiative.  
CREATE MULTIPLE DILEMMAS FOR THE ENEMY  
3-62.  Simultaneous operations across multiple domains â€”conducted in depth and supported by military 
deception â€”present enemy forces with multiple dilemmas. These operations d egrade enemy freedom of 
action, reduce enemy flexibility and endurance, and upset enemy  plans and coordination. Such operations 
place critical enemy functions at risk and deny enemy forces th e ability to synchronize or generate combat 
power. The application of capabilities in a complementary and r einforcing fashion creates more problems 
than the enemy commander can hope to solve, which erodes both e nemy effectiveness and the will to fight.  
3-63.  Deception is a critical supporting enabler for creating multipl e dilemmas, achieving operational 
surprise and maintaining the initiative. Successful deception o perations degrade the ability of threat 
commanders to decide and act on  accurate information. Deception  inhibits effective enemy action by 
increasing the time, space, and resources necessary to understa nd friendly courses of action. Well executed 
deception creates a cumulative effect on decision-making cycles , and can cause inaction, delay, misallocation 
of forces, and surprise as enemy  forces react to multiple real and false dilemmas. Deception is a force 
multiplier when properly resourced and executed.  
3-64.  Forcible entry operations can cre ate multiple dilemmas by creat ing threats that exceed an enemy 
force â€™s capability to respond. The capability to quickly project powe r across operational distances presents 
enemy forces with difficult decisions about how to array their forces in time and space. Rapid tactical 
maneuver to operational depth to  exploit a penetration or envel opment creates similar effects.  
3-65.  Creating multiple dilemmas requires the recognition of opportun ities to exploit. Understanding enemy 
dispositions and capabilities, an d the characteristics of the t errain and population, informs situational 
Chapter 3 
3-12 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 understanding and course of action development. Employing mutua lly supporting forces along different axes 
to strike from unexpected directions creates dilemmas, particul arly when Army and joint capabilities 
converge effects against enemy forces in multiple domains simul taneously. Commanders seek every 
opportunity to make enemy forces operate in different direction s against massed capabilities at the time and 
locations of their choosing. 
TENETS OF UNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS 
3-66. Tenets of operations  are desirable attributes that should be built into all plans a nd operations and are
directly related to the Army â€™s operational concept (ADP 1-01). The tenets are interrelated a nd mutually
supporting. Tenets of unified land operations describe the Army â€™s approach to generating and applying
combat power across the range of military operations during dec isive action. An operation is a military action,
consisting of two or more related tactical actions designed to accomplish a strategic objective in whole or in
part. A tactical action is a battle or engagement employing let hal and nonlethal actions designed for a specific
purpose relative to the enemy, the terrain, friendly forces, or  other entities. Operations can include an attack
to seize a piece of terrain or destroy an enemy unit, the defen se of a population, and the training of other
militaries to enable security forces as part of building partne r capacity. In the homeland, Army forces apply
the tenets of operations when supporting civil authorities to s ave lives, alleviate suffering, and protect
property. Army operations are characterized by four tenets:
zSimultaneity.
zDepth.
zSynchronization.
zFlexibility.
SIMULTANEITY
3-67. Simultaneity  is the execution of related and mutually supporting tasks at t he same time across
multiple locations and domains . Army forces operating simultaneously across the air, land, ma ritime, space,
and cyberspace domains presents dilemmas to adversaries and ene mies, while reassuring allies and
influencing neutrals. The simultaneous application of joint and  combined arms capabilities across the range
of military operations overwhelms the enemy physically and psyc hologically. Simultaneity requires creating
shared understanding and purpose through collaboration with all  elements of the friendly force. Commanders
synchronize the employment of capabilities while balancing temp o against sustainment capacity to produce
simultaneous results.
DEPTH
3-68. Depth is the extension of operations in time, space, or purpose to ac hieve definitive results . Army
forces engage enemy forces throu ghout their depth, preventing t he effective employment of reserves and
disrupting command and control, logistics, and other capabiliti es not in direct contact with friendly forces.
Operations in depth can disrupt the enemy â€™s decision cycle. They contribute to protection by destroying
enemy capabilities before enemy forces can use them. Empowering  subordinates to act with initiative
decentralizes decision making and increases tempo to achieve gr eater depth during operations.
3-69. Cyberspace operations, spac e-based capabilities, and psych ological operations provide opportunities
to engage adversaries and enemies across the depth of their for mations. Each have planning considerations
with regard to timing, authorities, and effects relative to phy sical actions in the land domain that should be
factored into friendly courses of action.
SYNCHRONIZATION
3-70. Synchronization  is the arrangement of military actions in time, space, and pur pose to produce
maximum relative combat power at a decisive place and time (JP 2-0). Synchronization is not the same as
simultaneity; it is the ability to execute multiple related and  mutually supporting tasks in different locations
at the same time. These actions produce greater effects than ex ecuting each in isolation. For example,
synchronization of information collection, obstacles, direct fi res, and indirect fires results in the destruction
The Armyâ€™s Operational Concept  
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 3-13 of enemy formations during a defense. When conducting an offens ive operation, synchronizing forces along 
multiple lines of operations forces enemy forces to distribute their capabilities instead of massing them.  
3-71.  Information networks and commander â€™s intent enable synchronization. Networks facilitate situationa l 
awareness and rapid communication. Subordinate and adjacent uni ts use their understanding of the 
commander â€™s intent to synchronize their actions with other units without direct control from higher echelon 
headquarters. Neither networks nor commander â€™s intent guarantee synchronization, but when used together 
they provide a powerful tool for leaders to synchronize their e fforts.  
3-72.  Commanders determine the degree of control necessary to synchro nize their operations. They balance 
synchronization with agility and initiative, but they never sur render the initiative for the sake of 
synchronization. Excessive synchronization can lead to too much  control, which limits the initiative of 
subordinates and undermines mission command.  
FLEXIBILITY  
3-73.  Flexibility  is the employment of a versatile mix of capabilities, formatio ns, and equipment for 
conducting operations . Commanders must be able to adapt to conditions as they change  and employ forces 
in a variety of ways. Flexibility facilitates collaborative pla nning and decentralized execution. Leaders learn 
from experience (their own and th at of others) and apply new kn owledge to each situation. Flexible plans 
help units adapt quickly to changing circumstances in operation s.  
3-74.  Flexibility and innovation are essential elements of any succes sful operation, and they are products of 
creative and adaptive leaders. Army forces continuously adapt a s operational environments change across 
the range of military operations. Flexibility is a critical ing redient of mission analysis, plans, and operations.  
SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF U NIFIED LAND OPERATIONS  
3-75.  Conducting unified land operations requires â€”  
z A clear commander â€™s intent and concept of operations that establishes the role of  each element 
and its contribution to accomplishing the mission. 
z A flexible and redundant command and control system. 
z A shared understanding of an ope rational environment and the pu rpose of the operation. 
z Proactive and continuous information collection and intelligenc e analysis. 
z In depth planning for, and when authorized, conduct of cyberspa ce operations. 
z Aggressive security operations. 
z Rapid task organization and re-task organization. 
z Disciplined initiative within the commander â€™s intent. 
z The ability to move quickly, ope rate dispersed, and sustain man euver over distance. 
z Planned, responsive, and anticipatory sustainment. 
z Combat power applied through combined arms. 
z Well-trained, cohesive teams and bold, imaginative leaders.  
z Accepting risk as opportunity while mitigating risk to the miss ion and force. 
z The ability to coordinate operatio ns with unified action partne rs. 
z The ability to consolidate gains. 
3-76.  Commanders change tactics, modify their exercise of command and  control, change task organization, 
and adjust the weight placed on each element of decisive action  throughout an operation. This helps to seize, 
retain, and exploit the initiative. Commanders base decisions o n their understanding of the situation, available 
r e s o u r c e s ,  a n d  t h e  f o r c e â€™s ability to conduct operations. Commanders assess the progress  of ongoing 
operations, changes in the situation, and the force â€™s combat effectiveness. Commanders also assess how well 
a current operation is shaping c onditions for subsequent missio ns.

Operations Structure 
Chapter 4 discusses the operational framework that enables comm anders to visualize 
and describe operations. It begins with the operations structur e as a whole. Then it 
discusses the operations process. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the Army 
operational framework. 
CONSTRUCT FOR OPERATIONS STRUCTURE 
4-1. The operations structure con sists of the operations process , combat power, and the operational
framework. This is the Army â€™s common construct for unified land operations. It allows Army leaders to
organize efforts rapidly, effectively, and in a manner commonly  understood across the Army. The operations
process provides a broadly defined approach to developing and e xecuting operations. The warfighting
functions provide a common organization for critical functions.  The operational framework provides Army
leaders with conceptual options for arraying forces and visuali zing and describing operations.
OPERATIONS PROCESS 
4-2. The operations process is a commander-led activity informed  by mission command principles. It
consists of the major command and control activities performed during operations: planning, preparing,
executing, and continuously assessing an operation. These activ ities may be sequential or simultaneous. They
are rarely discrete and often involve a great deal of overlap. Commanders use the oper ations process to drive
the planning necessary to understand, visualize, and describe t heir unique operational environments; make
and articulate decisions; and direct, lead, and assess military  operations. (See ADP 5-0 for a detailed
discussion of the operations process.)
4-3. Planning  is the art and science of understanding a situation, envisioni ng a desired future, and laying
out effective ways of bringing that future about (ADP 5-0). Pla nning consists of two separate but interrelated
components: a conceptual component and a detailed component. Su ccessful planning requires the integration
of both components. Army leaders employ three methodologies for  planning: the Army design methodology,
the military decision-making process, and troop leading procedu res (described in paragraphs 4-14 through
4-18). Commanders determine how much of each methodology to use  based on the scope of the problem,
their familiarity with the methodol ogy, the echelon, and the ti me available.
4-4. Preparation consists of those activities perfo rmed by units and Soldiers to  improve their ability to
execute an operation (ADP 5-0).  Preparation creates conditions that improve friendly forces â€™ opportunities
for success. It requires command er, staff, unit, and Soldier ac tions to ensure the force is trained, equipped,
and ready to execute operations . Preparation activities help co mmanders, staffs, and S oldiers understand a
situation and their roles in upcoming operations and set condit ions for successful execution.
4-5. Execution  is the act of putting a plan into action by applying combat po wer to accomplish the mission
and adjusting operations based on changes in the situation (ADP  5-0). Commanders and staffs use situational
understanding to assess progress and make execution and adjustm ent decisions. In execution, commanders
and staffs focus their efforts o n translating decisions into ac tions. They apply combat power to seize, retain,
and exploit the initiative to gain and maintain a position of r elative advantage. This is the essence of unified
land operations.
4-6. Finally, assessment  is determination of the progress toward accomplishing a task, creating a condition,
or achieving an objective (JP 3-0). Assessment precedes and the n occurs during the other activities of the
operations process. Assessment i nvolves deliberately comparing forecasted outcomes with actual events to
Chapter 4 
4-2 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 determine the overall effectiveness of force employment. Assess ment helps commanders determine progress 
toward achieving a desired end state, accomplishing objectives,  and performing tasks. 
ARMY DESIGN METHODOLOGY IN THE OPERATIONS PROCESS
4-7. The Army design methodology is useful as an aid to conceptu al thinking about unfamiliar problems.
To produce executable plans, commanders integrate the Army desi gn methodology with the detailed planning
typically associated with the military decision-making process.  Commanders who use the Army design
methodology may gain a greater understanding of an operational environment and its problems. Once they
have an understanding of the environment, they can better visua lize an appropriate operational approach.
This greater understanding allows  commanders to provide a clear  c o m m a n d e r â€™s intent and concept of
operations.
4-8. Army design methodology is iterative, collaborative, and co ntinuous. As the operations process
unfolds, the commander, staff, subordinates, and other partners  continue collaboration to improve their
shared understanding. An improved understanding may lead to mod ifications to the commander â€™s operational
approach or an entirely new approach altogether. (See ATP 5-0.1  for more information on Army design
methodology.)
THE MILITARY DECISION -MAKING PROCESS
4-9. The military decision-making process is an iterative planni ng methodology. It integrates activities of
the commander, staff, subordin ate headquarters, and other partn ers. This integration enables them to
understand the situation and miss ion; develop, analyze, and com pare courses of action; decide on the course
of action that best accomplishes the mission; and produce an or der for execution. The military
decision-making process app lies to both conceptual and detailed  approaches. It is most closely associated
with detailed planning.
4-10. For unfamiliar problems, executable solutions typically re quire integrating the Army design
methodology with the military decision-making process. The mili tary decision-making process helps leaders
apply thoroughness, clarity, sound judgment, logic, and profess ional knowledge, so they understand
situations, develop options to solve problems, and reach decisi ons. This process helps commanders, staffs,
and others to think critically and creatively while planning. ( See ADP 5-0 for more information on the
military decision-making process.)
TROOP LEADING PROCEDURES
4-11. Troop leading procedures is a dynamic process used by smal l-unit leaders to analyze a mission, develop
a plan, and prepare for an operation. Heavily weighted in favor  of familiar problems and short planning
periods, troop leading procedures are typically employed by org anizations without staffs at the company level
and below. Leaders use troop leading procedures to solve tactic al problems when working alone or with a
small group. For example, a company commander may use the execu tive officer, first sergeant, fire support
officer, supply sergeant, and communications sergeant to help d uring troop leading procedures. (See ADP 5-0
for more information on troop leading procedures.)
COMBAT POWER 
4-12. To execute operations, commanders conceptualize capabiliti es in terms of combat power. Combat
power has eight elements: leadership, information, command and control, movement and maneuver,
intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection. The Army coll ectively describes the last six elements as
warfighting functions. Commanders apply combat power through wa rfighting functions using leadership and
information. (See chapter 5 for a  discussion of combat power.)
ARMY OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK 
4-13. An operational framework is a cognitive tool that commande rs and staffs use to visualize and describe
the application of combat power, in time, space, purpose, and r esources, as they develop the concept of
operations. An operational framework organizes an area of geogr aphic and operational responsibility for the
Operations Structure 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 4-3 commander and provides a way to describe the employment of forc es. The framework illustrates the 
relationship between close operations, operations in depth, and  other operations in time and space across 
domains.  
4-14.  As a visualization tool, the operational framework bridges the gap between a unitâ€™s conceptual 
understanding of the environment and its need to generate detai led orders that direct operations. Staffs 
anticipate changes in the situation over time and plan to add, subtract, or update elements of the operational 
framework. This contributes to shared understanding and helps i nform the continuous adjustment of graphic 
control measures and other tool s to direct operations. Due to t he dynamic characteristics of operations, 
operational frameworks are dependent on the mission variables a nd not static templates.    
4-15.  The operational framework has four components. First, commander s are assigned an area of operations 
for the conduct of operations. Second, commanders can designate  deep, close, support, and consolidation 
areas to describe the physical a rrangement of forces in time an d space. Third, within these areas commanders 
conduct decisive, shaping, and sustaining operations to articul ate an operation in terms of purpose. Finally, 
commanders designate the main and supporting efforts to designa te the shifting prioritization of resources.  
AREA OF OPERATIONS  
4-16.  An area of operations  is an operational area defined b y a commander for land and mar itime forces that 
should be large enough to accomplish their missions and protect  their forces (JP 3-0). For land operations, 
an area of operations includes subordinate areas of operations assigned by Army commanders to their 
subordinate echelons. In operations , commanders use control mea sures to assign responsibilities, coordinate 
fire and maneuver, and control combat operations. A control measure  is a means of regulating forces or 
warfighting functions (ADP 6-0). One of the most important cont rol measures is the assigned area of 
operations. The Army commander or joint force land component co mmander is the supported commander 
within an area of operations designated by the JFC for land ope rations. Within their areas of operations, 
commanders integrate and synchronize combat power. To facilitat e this integration and synchronization, 
commanders designate targeting pr iorities, effects, and timing within their areas of operations. 
Responsibilities within an area of operations include â€” 
z Terrain management. 
z Information collection, integration, and synchronization. 
z Civil affairs operations. 
z Movement control. 
z Clearance of fires. 
z Security. 
z Personnel recovery. 
z Airspace control.  
z Minimum-essential stability operations tasks. 
4-17.  Commanders consider a unit â€™s area of influence when assigning it an area of operations. An  area of 
influence  is a geographical area wherein a commander is directly capable  of influencing operations by 
maneuver or fire support systems normally under the commander â€™s command or control (JP 3-0). 
Understanding an area of influen ce helps the commander and staf f plan branches to the current operation in 
which the force uses capabilities outside the area of operation s. An area of operations should not be 
substantially larger than the unit â€™s area of influence. Ideally, the area of influence would encom pass the entire 
area of operations. An area of operations that is too large for  a unit to effectively control increases risk, 
allowing sanctuaries for enemy forces and limiting joint flexib ility.  
4-18.  An area of interest  is that area of concern to the commander, including the area o f influence, areas 
adjacent thereto, and extending into enemy territory (JP 3-0). This area also includes areas occupied by enemy 
forces who could jeopardize the accomplishment of the mission. An area of interest for stability or DSCA 
may be much larger than that area associated with the offense a nd defense. The area of interest always 
encompasses aspects of the air, cyberspace, and space domains, since capabilities resident in all three enable 
and affect operations on land.  
Chapter 4 
4-4 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 4-19. Areas of operations may be contiguous or noncontiguous. Wh en they are contiguous, a boundary
separates them. When areas of operations are noncontiguous, sub ordinate commands do not share a boundary.
The higher echelon headquarters retains responsibility for area s not assigned to subordinate units.
DEEP,CLOSE ,SUPPORT ,AND CONSOLIDATION AREAS
4-20. The deep area  is where the commander sets conditions for future success in c lose combat.
Operations in the deep area involve efforts to prevent uncommit ted enemy forces from being committed in a
coherent manner. A commander â€™s deep area generally extends beyond subordinate unit boundarie s out to the
limits of the commander â€™s designated area of operations . The purpose of operations in t he deep area is often
tied to setting conditions for future events in time and space.  Operations in the deep area might disrupt the
movement of operational reserves o r prevent enemy forces from e mploying long-range fires. In an
operational environment where the enemy recruits insurgents fro m a population, deep operations might focus
on interfering with the recruiting process, disrupting the trai ning of recruits, or eliminating the underlying
factors that enable the enemy to recruit. Planning for operatio ns in the deep area includes considerations for
information collection, airspace control, joint fires, obstacle  emplacement, maneuver (air and ground),
special operations, and i nformation operations.
4-21. The higher echelon headquarters is responsible for deep ar eas within its area of operations. In some
instances, a deep area may focus along a single line of operati on. In other instances, a deep area may focus
along multiple lines of operations. The mission variables of ME TT-TC inform the methods leaders use to
direct operations in a deep area.
4-22. The close area  is the portion of the commander â€™s area of operations where the majority of
subordinate maneuver forces conduct close combat.  Operations in the close area are within a subordinate
commander â€™s area of operations. Commanders plan to conduct decisive opera tions using maneuver and fires
in the close area, and they position most of the maneuver force  in it. In the close area, depending on the
echelon, one unit may conduct the decisive operation while othe rs conduct shaping operations to fix a specific
enemy formation or defeat remnants of by-passed or defeated ene my forces. Planning for operations in the
close area includes fire control measures, movement control mea sures, maneuver, and obstacle emplacement.
Operations in the close area are inherently lethal because they  often involve direct fire engagements with
enemy forces seeking to mass dir ect, indirect, and aerial fires  against friendly forces.
4-23. A support area  is the portion of the commander â€™s area of operations that is designated to facilitate
the positioning, employment, and  protection of base sustainment  assets required to sustain, enable,
and control operations . Commanders assign a support area as a subordinate area of ope rations to support
functions. It is where most of the echelon â€™s sustaining operations occur. Within a division or corps suppo rt
area, a designated unit such as a brigade combat team (BCT) or maneuver enhancement brigade provides
area security, terrain management, movement control, mobility s upport, clearance of fires, and tactical
combat forces for security. This allows sustainment units to fo cus on their primary function. Corps and
divisions may have one or multiple support areas, located as re quired to best support the force. These areas
may be non-contiguous to the other areas, in the close area, or  in the consolidation area.
4-24. The consolidation area  is the portion of the land commanderâ€™s area of operations that may be
designated to facilitate freedom of action, consolidate gains t hrough decisive action, and set conditions
to transition the area of operations to follow on forces or oth er legitimate authorities . Commanders
establish a consolidation area, pa rticularly in the offense as the friendly force gains territory, to exploit tactical
success while enabling freedom of action for forces operating i n the other areas. A con solidation area has all
the characteristics of a close area, with the purpose to consol idate gains through decisive action once
large-scale ground combat has largely ended in that particular area of operations.
4-25. The consolidation area does not necessarily need to surrou ndâ€”nor contain â€”the support area base
clusters. It requires a purpose fully task-organized, combined a rms unit to perform area security and stability
tasks and employ and clear fires. This unencumbers units conduc ting close operations and enables the higher
echelon headquarters to focus o n close operations, deep operati ons, and future planning. Corps and divisions
may designate multiple consolidation areas. Units designated to  a consolidation area conduct decisive action
to defeat remnants of defeated or by-passed forces and stabiliz e the area for transition to legitimate authority.
The forces necessary to consolidate gains represent a separate and distinct requirement beyond the BCTs and
Operations Structure 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 4-5 divisions required to conduct close and deep operations. To con solidate gains properly, the theater army plans 
and requests the additional required forces through the force-t ailoring process.  
DECISIVE , SHAPING , AND SUSTAINING OPERATIONS  
4-26.  Decisive, shaping, and sustaining operations lend themselves to  a broad conceptual orientation. The  
decisive operation  is the operation that directly accomplishes the mission . The decisive operation is the 
focal point around which commanders design an entire operation.  The decisive operation is designed to 
determine the outcome of a major operation, battle, or engageme nt. Multiple subordinate units may be 
engaged in the same decisive operation across multiple domains.  Decisive operations lead directly to the 
accomplishment of the commander â€™s intent.  
4-27.  A shaping operation  is an operation at any echelon that creates and preserves cond itions for 
success of the decisive operation through effects on the enemy,  other actors, and the terrain.  Information 
operations, for example, may integrate engagement tasks into an  operation to reduce tensions between Army 
units and different ethnic groups. In combat, synchronizing the  effects of aircraft, artillery fires, and 
obscurants to delay or disrupt r epositioning forces illustrates  shaping operations. Shaping operations may 
occur throughout the area of operations and involve any combina tion of forces and capabilities across 
multiple domains. Shaping operations set conditions for the suc cess of the decisive operation. Commanders 
may designate more than one shaping operation.  
4-28.  A sustaining operation  is an operation at any echelon that enables the decisive opera tion or 
shaping operations by generating and maintaining combat power.  Sustaining operations focus internally 
on friendly forces while decisive  and shaping operations focus externally on the enemy or environment. 
Sustaining operations include personnel and logistics support, support area security, movement control, 
terrain management, and infrastructure development.  
4-29.  Sustaining operations are inseparable from decisive and shaping  operations. Sustaining operations 
occur throughout the area of operations, not just within a supp ort area. Failure to sustain results in mission 
failure. Sustaining operations determine endurance, tempo, and operational reach. They also determine how 
quickly Army forces reconstitute and how far Army forces can ex ploit success.  
4-30.  Throughout decisive, shaping, an d sustaining operations, comman ders and their staffs need to ensure 
thatâ€” 
z Forces maintain positions of relative advantage. 
z Operations are integrated with unified action partners. 
z Continuity is maintained throughout operations. 
Position of Relative Advantage  
4-31.  A position of relative advantage  is a location or the establishm ent of a favorable condition wi thin 
the area of operations that provides the commander with tempora ry freedom of action to enhance 
combat power over an enemy or influence the enemy to accept ris k and move to a position of 
disadvantage.  Positions of relative advantage may extend across multiple dom ains to provide opportunities 
for units to compel, persuade, o r deter enemy decisions or acti ons. Commanders seek and create positions of 
advantage to exploit through action, and they continually asses s friendly and enemy forces in relation to each 
other for opportunities to exploit. A key aspect in achieving a  position of advantage is maneuver,  which is 
movement in conjunction with fires.   
4-32.  Army forces must quickly both recognize and exploit positions o f relative advantage because they are 
likely to be temporary when faced with capable, adaptive enemy forces attempting to gain a position of 
advantage over friendly forces. Commanders and staffs analyze r elative capabilities across all domains that 
can influence an operation. Significant advantages in one domai n can significantly offset disadvantages in 
another.  
Integration  
4-33.  Army forces operate as a part of a larger joint and multination al effort with numerous unified action 
partners. Army leaders integrate Army capabilities within this larger effort. Commanders, enabled by their 
Chapter 4 
4-6 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 staffs, integrate numerous processes and activities within thei r formations and across the joint force. 
Integration involves efforts to operate with unified action par tners and efforts to employ Army capabilities 
as part of the larger operational concept.  
4-34. Army leaders use Army capabilities to complement those of their unified action partners. They also
depend on partners â€™ capabilities to supplement Army capabilities. Effective integr ation requires staffs to
create a shared understanding a nd purpose through collaboration  with unified action partners.
Continuity 
4-35.  Decision making during operations is continuous; it is no t a discrete event. Commanders carefully
balance priorities between current and future operations as par t of controlling risk. They seek to accomplish
the mission effectively while conserving resources for future o perations. To maintain continuity of
operations, commanders and staffs establish branches and sequel s that facilitate future operations and reduce
the risk inherent to transitions.
4-36. Commanders only make change s to plans when necessary. This  presents subordinates with the fewest
possible changes and the most time to spend on their own planni ng and execution. The fewer the changes,
the less planning needed, and the greater the chance that the c hanges will be executed successfully.
4-37. When possible, commanders should ensure that changes do no t preclude options for future operations.
Normally this applies only to higher echelons with organic plan ning capabilities. Staffs develop options
during planning, or commanders infer them based on their assess ment of the current situation. Developing or
inferring options depends on va lidating earlier assumptions and  updating planning factors and running
estimates. Future operations may be war-gamed using updated pla nning factors, estimates, and assumptions.
MAIN AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS
4-38. Commanders designate main and supporting efforts to establ ish clear priorities of support and
resources among subordinate units. The main effort  is a designated subordinate unit whose mission at a
given point in time is most critical to overall mission success . It is usually weighted with the preponderance
of combat power. Typically, commanders shift the main effort on e or more times during execution.
Designating a main effort temporarily prioritizes resource allo cation. When commanders designate a unit as
the main effort, it receives priority of support and resources to maximize combat power. Commanders
establish clear priorities of support, and they shift resources  and priorities to the main effort as circumstances
and the commander â€™s intent require. Commanders may designate a unit conducting a shaping operation as
the main effort until the decisive operation commences. However , the unit with primary responsibility for
the decisive operation then becomes the main effort upon the ex ecution of the decisive operation.
4-39. A supporting effort  is a designated subordinate unit with a mission that supports the success of
the main effort.  Commanders resource supporting efforts with the minimum assets  necessary to accomplish
the mission. Forces often realize success of the main effort th rough success of supporting efforts.

Combat Power 
This chapter discusses combat power. It first discusses the ele ments of combat power. 
The next section covers the six warfighting functions: command and control, 
movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and pr otection. Lastly, the 
chapter discusses the means of organizing combat power.
THE ELEMENTS OF COMBAT POWER 
5-1. Combat power  is the total means of destructive, constructive, and informati on capabilities that a
military unit or formation can apply at a given time.  Operations executed through simultaneous offensive,
defensive, stability, or DSCA operations require the continuous  generation and application of combat power.
To an Army commander, Army forces generate combat power by conv erting potential into effective action.
Combat power includes all capabilities provided by unified acti on partners that are integrated and
synchronized with the commander â€™s objectives to achieve unity of effort in sustained operations .
5-2. To execute combined arms operations, commanders conceptuali ze capabilities in terms of combat
power. Combat power has eight elements: leadership, information , command and control, movement and
maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection. The  elements facilitate Army forces accessing
joint and multinational fires and assets. The Army collectively  describes the last six elements as warfighting
functions. Commanders apply combat power through the warfightin g functions using leadership and
information. (See figure 5-1.)
Figure 5-1. The elements of combat power 

Chapter 5 
5-2 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 5-3. Generating and maintaining combat power throughout an opera tion is essential. Factors that contribute 
to generating  and maintainin g combat  power  include  reserves, force rotation,  network  viability,  access to 
cyberspace  and space  enab lers, and joint support.  Commanders  balance  the ability  to mass  lethal  and 
nonlethal effects with the need to deploy and sustain the units  that p roduce those effects. They balance the 
ability to accomplish the mission with the ability to project a nd sustain the force.
5-4. Commanders apply leadership through mission command. Leadership is a multiplying and unify ing 
element of combat power. The Army defines leadership as the activity of influencing peo ple by  providing  
purpose, direction, and motivatio n to accomplish the missio n and improve the organization (ADP 6-22). An 
Army  commander,  by virtue  of assumed  role or assigned  responsib ility, inspires and influences  people  to 
accomplish organizational goals. (See ADP 6-22 for a detailed d iscussion of Army leadership .)
5-5. Information  enables  commanders  at all levels  to make  informed decisions  about  the application  of 
combat  power  and achieve  definitive  results.  Knowledge  manageme nt enables  commanders  to make 
informed,  timely  decisions  under  ambiguous  and time-constrained  conditions.  Information  management 
helps  determine  what  among  the vast amounts of informatio n available  is important.  Information 
management uses p rocedures and information systems to  facilitate collecting, processing, storing, displaying, 
disseminating, and protecting knowledge and information.
5-6. Commanders  and their units  must  coordinate  what  they do, say, and portray.  Fundamental  to this 
coordination is the development of information themes and messa ges. An information theme is a unifying or 
dominant  idea or image  that expresses  the purpose  for military  action.  A messag e is a narrowly  focused 
commu nication directed  at a spec ific audience to suppo rt a spec ific theme (JP 3-61). Themes and messag es 
are tied  to objectives, lines of effort, and end state conditio ns. Information themes are overarching and apply 
to capabilities  of public  affair s, military  information  support  operations,  and audience  engagements. 
Commanders  employ  themes  and messages  as part of planned  activi ties designed  to influence  foreign 
audiences in suppo rt current or planned operatio ns.
5-7. Every operation involves cyberspace electromagnetic activit ies. Cyberspace electromagnetic activities 
is the process of planning,  integ rating,  and synchronizing cyberspace  and electronic  warfare 
operations in support of unified land operations.  (This is also known as CEMA.) Cyberspace operations 
is the employment of cybersp ace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through 
cyberspace (JP 3-0). Electronic warfare  is military action involving the use of electromagnetic and di rected 
energy to contro l the electromag netic spectrum or to attack the  enemy (JP 3-13. 1).
5-8. Army  cyberspace  and electronic  warfare  operations  are condu cted to seize, retain,  and exploit 
advantages  in cyberspace  and the electromagnetic  spectru m. Thes e operatio ns support  decisive  action 
through  the accomplishment  of six core missions:  offensive  cybe rspace  operations,  defensive  cyberspace 
operations,  DOD  information  network  operations,  electronic attack, electronic  protection, and electronic 
warfare support. Commanders and staffs perform cyberspace elect romagnetic activities to project power in 
cyberspace  and the electromagnetic  spectrum;  secure  and defend  friendly  force  networks;  and protect 
personnel,  facilities,  and equipm ent. Spectrum  management  opera tions  are a critical  enabler  of integrated 
cyberspace operations and electronic warfare. (See FM 3-12 for a discussion of cyberspace operations an d 
electronic warfare.)
THE SIX WARFIGHTING FUNCTIONS 
5-9. A warfighting function  is a group of tasks and systems united by a common purpose tha t
commanders use to accomplish mis sions and training objectives.  Warfighting functions are the physical
means that tactical commanders use to execute operations and ac complish missions assigned by superior
tactical- and operational-level commanders. The purpose of warf ighting functions is to provide an intellectual
organization for common critical capabilities available to comm anders and staffs at all echelons and levels
of warfare. Commanders integrate and synchronize these capabili ties with other warfighting functions to
accomplish objectives and missions.
5-10. All warfighting functions possess scalable capabilities to facilitate lethal and nonlethal effects. All the
functions implement various systems such as personnel and netwo rks to integrate forces and synchronize
activities. Commanders should remember that cyber-related platf orms that support integration and
Combat Power 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 5-3synchronization must be protected and defended. Combined arms operations use the capabilities of each 
function, along with leadership and information, in complementary and reinforcing capabilities.  
COMMAND AND CONTROL WARFIGHTING FUNCTION
5-11.  The command and control warfighting function  is the related tasks and a system that enable
commanders to synchronize and converge all elements of combat p ower.  The primary purpose of the
command and control warfighting function is to assist commanders in integrating the other elements o f
co
mbat power (leadership, inform ation, movement and maneuver, i ntelligence, fires, sustainment, and
protection) to achieve objectives and accomplish missions. The command and control warfighting func tion
co
nsists of the command and control warfighting function tasks and the command and control system. (See
figure 5-2.)
Figure 5-2. Command and co ntrol warfighting function 
5-12.  The command and control warfighting function tasks focus on int egrating the activities of the oth er
ele
ments of combat power to accomplish missions. Commanders, as sisted by their staffs, integrate numerous
processes and activities within  their headquarters and across t he force through the command and cont rol
w
arfighting function. These tasks are â€”
zCommand forces.
zControl operations.
zDrive the oper ations process.
zEstablish the command and control system.
MOVEMENT AND MANEUVER WARFIGHTING FUNCTIO N
5-13.  The movement and maneuver warfighting function  is the related tasks and systems that move and
employ forces to achieve a position of relative advantage over the enemy and other threats.  Direct fire
and close combat are inherent in maneuver. The movement and man euver warfighting function includes tasks
associated with force projection. Movement is necessary to disp erse and displace the f orce as a whole or i n
part 
when maneuvering. Maneuver directly gains or exploits posi tions of relative advantage. Command ers
u
se maneuver for massing effects to achieve surprise, shock, and momentum. Effective maneuver requires
close coordination of fires and movement. Both tactical and operational maneuver require sustainmen t
s
upport. The movement and maneuver warfighting function include s these tasks :
zMove.
zManeuver.
zEmploy direct fires.
zOccupy an area.

Chapter 5 
5-4 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 zConduct mobility and countermobility.
zConduct reconnaissance and surveillance.
zEmploy battlefield obscuration.
5-14. The movement and maneuver warfighting function does not in clude administrative movements of
personnel and materiel. Those movements fall under the sustainm ent warfighting function. (See ADP 4-0 for
a discussion of force projection.)
INTELLIGENCE WARFIGHTING FUNCTION
5-15. The intelligence warfighting function  is the related tasks an d systems that facilitate
understanding the enemy, terrain, weather, civil considerations , and other significant aspects of the
operational environment.  Other significant aspects of an operational environment includ e threats,
adversaries, and operational variables, which vary with the nat ure of operations. The intelligence warfighting
function synchronizes information collection with primary tacti cal tasks of reconnaissance, surveillance,
security, and intelligence operations. Intelligence is driven b y commanders, and it involves analyzing
information from all sources and conducting operations to devel op the situation. The Army executes
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance through operatio ns and intelligence processes, with an
emphasis on intelligence analysis and information collection. T he intelligence warfighting function includes
these tasks:
zProvide intelligence support to force generation.
zProvide support to situational understanding.
zConduct information collection.
zProvide intelligence support to targeting and information capab ilities.
5-16. The intelligence warfighting function executes the tasks n eeded to prepare intelligence support to all
echelons deployed within a theater of operation. There are thre e core tasks. First, the staff establishes and
builds an intelligence architecture. Second, the staff builds t he knowledge base needed to understand an
operational environment throug h coordination and collaboration with regionally aligned forces using the
theater military intelligence brigade. Building the knowledge t o understand an operational environment
includes connecting the intelligence architecture to theater in formation systems. Last, the staff supports
engagement, develops context, and builds relationships through the successful conduct of intelligence
operations; intelligence analysis ; and intelligence processing,  exploitation, and dissemination. (See ADP 2-0
for a discussion of the intelligence warfighting function and s etting the theater.)
FIRES WARFIGHTING FUNCTION
5-17. The fires warfighting function  is the related tasks and systems that create and converge effe cts in
all domains against the adversary or enemy to enable operations  across the range of military operations
(ADP 3-0).  These tasks and systems create lethal and nonlethal effects de livered from both Army and joint
forces, as well as other unified action partners. The fires war fighting function does not wholly encompass,
nor is it wholly encompassed by, any particular branch or funct ion. Many of the capabilities that contribute
to fires also contribute to other warfighting functions, often simultaneously. For example, an aviation unit
may simultaneously execute missions that contribute to the move ment and maneuver, fires, intelligence,
sustainment, protection, and comma nd and control warfighting fu nctions.
5-18. Commanders must execute and integrate fires, in combinatio n with the other elements of combat
power, to create and converge effects and achieve the desired e nd state. Fires tasks are those necessary actions
that must be conducted to create and converge effects in all do mains to meet the commanderâ€™s objectives.
The tasks of the fires warfighting function are â€”
zExecute fires across the five domains and in the information en vironment, employing â€”
ÂƒSurface-to-surface fires.
ÂƒAir-to-surface fires.
ÂƒSurface-to-air fires.
ÂƒCyberspace operations and electronic warfare.
Combat Power 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 5-5 Âƒ Space operations. 
Âƒ Multinational fires. 
Âƒ Special operations. 
Âƒ Information operations. 
z Integrate Army, multinational, and joint fires though â€” 
Âƒ Targeting. 
Âƒ Operations process. 
Âƒ Fire support planning. 
Âƒ Airspace planning and management. 
Âƒ Electromagnetic spectrum management. 
Âƒ Multinational integration. 
Âƒ Rehearsals. 
The fires tasks are discussed further in ADP 3-19. 
SUSTAINMENT WARFIGHTING FUNCTION  
5-19.  The sustainment warfighting function is one of the eight elemen ts of combat power: leadership, 
information, command and control, movement and maneuver, intell igence, fires, sustainment, and protection. 
The sustainment warfighting function  is the related tasks and systems that provide support and serv ices 
to ensure freedom of action, extended operational reach, and pr olong endurance.  Sustainment 
determines the depth and duration of Army operations. Successfu l sustainment enables freedom of action by 
increasing the number of options available to the commander. Su stainment is essential for retaining and 
exploiting the initiative. The sustainment warfighting function  consists of four elements:   
z Logistics. 
z Financial management. 
z Personnel services. 
z Health service support. 
(See ADP 4-0 for additional information on the sustainment warf ighting function.) 
Logistics  
5-20.  Logistics  is planning and executing the movement and support of forces. It includes those aspects of 
military operations that deal wit h: design and development; acq uisition, storage, movement, distribution, 
maintenance, and disposition of materiel; acquisition or constr uction, maintenance, operation, and disposition 
of facilities; and acquisition or furnishing of services (ADP 4 -0.) The explosive ordnance disposal tasks are 
discussed under the protection warfighting function. Army logis tics elements are maintenance, 
transportation, supply, field services, distribution, operation al contract support, and general engineering. (See 
FM 4-95 for additional information on logistics.) 
Financial Management  
5-21.  Financial management leverages fiscal policy and economic power  across the range of military 
operations. Financial management encompasses finance operations  and resource management. (See FM 1-06 
for additional details on financial management.)  
Personnel Services  
5-22.  Personnel services  are sustainment functions that man and fund the force, maintai n Soldier and Family 
readiness, promote the moral and ethical values of the Nation, and enable the fighting qualities of the Army 
(ADP 4-0). Personnel services include planning, coordination, a nd sustaining personnel efforts at the 
operational and tactical levels. Personnel services include hum an resources support, legal support, religious 
support, and band support. (See ATP 1-19, FM 1-0, FM 1-04, and FM 1-05 for additional information on 
personnel services.)  
Chapter 5 
5-6 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 Health Service Support 
5-23. Army Health System support includes both health service su pport and force health protection which
are critical capabilities embedded within formations across all  warfighting functions. The force health
protection mission falls under the protection warfighting funct ion. (See ADP 3-37 for more information on
the force health protection mission. See FM 4-02 for more infor mation on health service support and the
Army Health System.)
5-24. Health service support encompasses all support and service s performed, provided, and arranged by the
Army Medical Department to promote, improve, conserve, or resto re the behavioral and physical well-being
of Army personnel and as directed , unified action partners. Hea lth service support includes casualty care,
which encompasses a number of medical functions, including â€”
zMedical treatment (including org anic and area medical support).
zHospitalization.
zDental care (including treatment aspects).
zBehavioral health and neuropsychiatric treatment.
zClinical laboratory services.
zTreatment of chemical, biolog ical, radiological, and nuclear pa tients.
zMedical evacuation (including medical regulating).
zMedical logistics (including blood management).
Protection Warfighting Function 
5-25. The protection warfighting function  is the related tasks and system s that preserve the force so th e
commander can apply maximum combat power to accomplish the miss ion. Commanders incorporate
protection when they understand and visualize threats and hazar ds in an operational environment. This allows
them to synchronize and integrate all protection capabilities t o safeguard bases, secure routes, and protect
forces. Preserving the force includes protecting personnel (com batants and noncombatants) and physical
assets of the United States, unified action partners, and host nations. The protection warfighting function
enables the commander to maintain the forceâ€™s integrity and combat power. Protection determines the d egree
to which potential threats can disrupt operations to counter or  mitigate those threats before they can act.
However, protection is not a linear activity â€”planning, preparing, executing, and assessing protection is a
continuous and enduring activity. Effective physical security m easures, like any defensive measures, overlap
and deploy in depth. Prioritization of protection capabilities are situationally dependent and
resource-informed. Protection activities include developing and  maintaining the protection prioritization list.
5-26. The protection warfighting function includes these tasks:
zConduct survivability operations.
zProvide force health protection.
zConduct chemical, biological, rad iological, and nuclear operati ons.
zProvide explosive ordnance disposal support.
zCoordinate air and missile defense support.
zConduct personnel recovery.
zConduct detention operations.
zConduct risk management.
zImplement physical security procedures.
zApply antiterrorism measures.
zConduct police operations.
zConduct population and resource control.
zConduct area security.
zPerform cyberspace security and defense.
zConduct electromagnetic protection.
zImplement operations security.

ORGANIZING COMBAT POWER  
5-27.  Commanders employ three means to organize combat power. These m eans include force tailoring,
task-organizing, and mutual su pport.
FORCE TAILORING  
5-28.  Force tailoring  is the process of determining the right mix of forces and the sequence of t heir
deploy
ment in support of a joint force commander.  It involves selecting the right force structure for a
joint operation from available units within a combatant command  or from the Army force pool. Commanders
then sequence forces into the area of operations as part of for ce projection. JFCs request and receive fo rces
f
or each campaign phase, adjusting the quantity of Service comp onent forces to match the weight of effort.
Army Service component commanders tailor forces to meet land fo rce requirements as determined by JFCs.
Army Service component commanders  also recommend forces and a d eployment sequence to meet tho se
req
uirements. Force tailoring is continuous. As new forces rota te into the area of operations, forces wi th
ex
cess capabilities return to the supporting combatant and Army  Service component commands.
TASK ORGANIZATION
5-29.  Task-organizing  is the act of designing a force, support staff, or sustainment  package of specific
size 
and composition to meet a unique task or mission.  Characteristics to examine when task-organizing
the force include, but are not limited to, the mission, trainin g, experience, unit capabilities, sustainability, the
operational environment, and the enemy threat. Task-organizing includes allocating assets to subordina te
com
manders and establishing th eir command and support relations hips. This occurs within tailored fo rce
pack
ages as commanders organize subordinate units for specific missions and employ doctrinal command
and support relationships. As task-organizing continues, comman ders reorganize units for subsequent
missions. The ability of Army forces to task-organize gives the m extraordinary agility. It lets commanders
configure their units to best use available resources. It also allows Army forces to match unit capabilities to
tasks. The ability of sustainmen t forces to tailor and task-org anize ensures commanders have freedom of
action to change with mission requirement s.
MUTUAL SUPPO RT
5-30.  Commanders consider mutual suppor t when task-organizing forces,  assigning areas of operations, and
pos
itioning units. Understanding mutual support and the time to  accept risk during operations are
fundamental to the art of tactics. In Army doctrine, mutual sup port is a planning consideration related to f orce
dis
position, not a command relationship. Mutual support has two  aspects â€”supporting range and supportin g
dis
tance. When friendly forces are static, supporting range equ als supporting distan ce.
5-
31. Supporting range  is the distance one unit may be geographically separated from a second unit
yet remain within the maximum range of the second unit â€™s weapons systems.  It depends on availab le
w
eapons systems and is normally the maximum range of the suppor ting unit â€™s indirect fire weapons. F or
s
mall units (such as squads, sections, and platoons), it is the  distance between two units that their direct fires
can cover effectively. Visibility may limit the supporting rang e. If one unit cannot effectively or safely fi re
t
o support another, the first may not be in supporting range, e ven though its weapons have the required range .
5-
32. Supporting distance  is the distance between two units that can be traveled in time  for one to come
to the aid of the other and prevent its defeat by an enemy or e nsure it regains control of a civil situation.
These factors affect supporting distan ce:
zTerrain and mobility.
zDistan ce.
zEnemy capabilities.
zFriendly capabilitie s.
zReaction time.
Chapter 5 
5-8 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 5-33. The capabilities of supported and supporting units affect supporting distance. Units may be within
supporting distance, but if the supported unit cannot communica te with the supporting unit, the supporting
unit may not be able to affect the operation â€™s outcome. In such cases, the units are not within supporting
distance regardless of their pro ximity to each other. If the un its share a common operational picture, relative
proximity may be less important than both units â€™ abilities to coordinate their man euver and fires. To exploit
the advantage of supporting distance, units synchronize maneuve r and fires more effectively than enemy
forces do. Otherwise, enemy forc es may be able to defeat both u nits in detail.
5-34. Commanders consider the supporting distance in operations dominated by stability or DSCA tasks.
Units maintain mutual support when one unit can draw on another  unitâ€™s capabilities. An interdependent joint
force may make proximity less significant than available capabi lity. For example, Air Force assets may be
able to move a preventive medicine detachment from an intermedi ate staging base to an operational area
threatened by an epidemic.
5-35. Conventional and special operations forces may operate in proximity to each other to accomplish the
JFCâ€™s mission. These two forces help and complement each other with  mutual support so they can accomplish
an objective that otherwise might not be attainable. Extended o r large-scale operations involving both
conventional and special operations forces require the integrat ion and synchronization of conventional and
special operations efforts. The JTF commander must consider the  different capabilities and limitations of
both conventional and special operations forces, particularly i n the areas of command and control and
sustainment. Exchanging liaison elements between conventional a nd special operations staffs further
integrates efforts of all forces concerned. (For more informati on on coordinating conventional and special
operations forces, see FM 6-05.)
5-36. Improved access to joint capabilities gives commanders add itional means to achieve mutual support.
Those capabilities can extend the operating distances between A rmy units. Army commanders can substitute
joint capabilities for mutual support between subordinate force s. Using joint capabilities multiplies
supporting distance many times over. Army forces can then exten d operational reach over greater areas at a
higher tempo. Joint capabilities are especially useful when sub ordinate units operate in noncontiguous areas
of operations that place units beyond a supporting range or sup porting distance. However, depending on joint
capabilities outside an Army commander â€™s direct control entails accepting risk when enemy forces can
control multiple domains.
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 A-1Appendix A 
Command and Support Relationships 
Command and support relationships provide the basis for unity o f command and unity 
of effort in operations. All command and support relationships fall within the 
framework of joint doctrine. JP 1 discusses joint command relat ionships and 
authorities. Since Army support relationships differ from joint , commanders use Army 
support relationships when task-organizing Army forces.
COMMAND 
A-1. Command is central to all military action, and unity of com mand is central to unity of effort. Inherent
in command is the authority that a military commander lawfully exercises over subordinates, including the
authority to assign missions and accountability for their succe ssful completion. Although commanders may
delegate authority to accomplish missions, they may not absolve  themselves of the responsibility for the
accomplishment of these missions. Authority is never absolute; the extent of authority is specified by the
establishing authority, directives, and law. (See JP 1 for more  information on command and authority.)
SUPPORT RELATIONSHIP 
A-2. A support relationship is established by a common superior commander between subordinate
commanders when one organization should aid, protect, complemen t, or sustain another force. The support
relationship is used by the Secretary of Defense to establish a nd prioritize support between and among
combatant commander, and it is used by JFCs to establish suppor t relationships between and among
subordinate commanders. (See JP 1 for more information on suppo rt relationships.)
CHAIN OF COMMAND 
A-3. The President and Secretary of  Defense exercise authority a nd control of the armed forces through two
distinct branches of the chain of command. (See figure A-1 on p age A-2.) One branch runs from the President,
through the Secretary of Defense, to the combatant commanders f or missions and forces assigned to
combatant commands. The other branch runs from the President th rough the Secretary of Defense to the
secretaries of the military departments. This branch is used fo r purposes other than operational direction of
forces assigned to the combatant commands. Each military depart ment operates under the authority,
direction, and control of the secretary of that military depart ment. These secretaries exercise authority
through their respective Service chiefs over Service forces not  assigned to combatant commanders. The
Service chiefs, except as otherwise prescribed by law, perform their duties under the authority, direction, and
control of the secretaries to whom they are directly responsibl e. (See JP 1 for more information on the chain
of command.)
A-4. A typical operational chain of command extends from the com batant commander to a JTF commander,
then to a functional component commander or a Service component  commander. JTF and functional
component commands, such as a land component, comprise forces t hat are normally subordinate to a Service
component command but have been placed under the operational co ntrol (OPCON) of the JTF, and
subsequently to a functional component commander. Conversely, t he combatant commander may designate
one of the Service component commanders as the JTF commander or  as a functional component commander.
In some cases, the combatant commander may not establish a JTF,  retaining OPCON over subordinate
functional commands and Service components directly.
Appendix A 
A-2 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 Figure A-1. Chain of command branches 
A-5. Under joint doctrine, each joint force includes a Service c omponent command that provides
administrative and logistic support to Service forces under OPC ON of that joint force. However, Army
doctrine distinguishes between the Army component of a combatan t command and Army components of
subordinate joint forces. Under Army doctrine, Army Service com ponent command (ASCC) refers to the
Army component assigned to a combatant command. There is only o ne ASCC within a combatant
commandâ€™s area of responsibility.  The Army components of all other joint forces are called ARFOR s. An
ARFOR  is the Army component and senior Army headquarters of all Army  forces assigned or attached to a

Command and Support Relationships 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 A-3 combatant command, subordinate joint force command, joint funct ional command, or multinational 
command (FM 3-94). It consists of the senior Army headquarters and its commander (when not designated 
as the JFC) and all Army forces that the combatant commander su bordinates to the JTF or places under the 
control of a multinational force commander. The ARFOR becomes t he conduit for most Service-related 
issues and administrative support. The ASCC may function as an ARFOR headquarters when the combatant 
commander does not exercise command and control through subordi nate JFCs. 
A-6. The Secretary of the Army directs the flow of administrative co ntrol (ADCON). ADCON for Army 
units within a combatant command normally extends from the Secr etary of the Army through the ASCC, 
through an ARFOR, and then to Army units assigned or attached t o an Army headquarters within that joint 
command. However, ADCON is not tied to the operational chain of  command. The Secretary of the Army 
may redirect some or all Service responsibilities outside the n ormal ASCC channels. In similar fashion, the 
ASCC may distribute some administrative responsibilities outsid e the ARFOR. Their primary considerations 
are the effectiveness of Army fo rces and the care of Soldiers.  
COMBATANT COMMANDS  
A-7. The Unified Command Plan establishes combatant commanders â€™ missions and geographic 
responsibilities. Combatant commanders directly link operationa l military forces to the Secretary of Defense 
and the President. The Secretary of Defense deploys troops and exercises military power through the 
combatant commands. Six combatant commands have areas of respon sibility. They are the geographic 
combatant commands. Each geographic combatant command has (or w ill have) an assigned ASCC. For 
doctrinal purposes, these commands become theater armies to dis tinguish them from the similar organizations 
assigned to functional component commands. The geographic comba tant commands and their theater armies 
areâ€” 
z U.S. Northern Command (U.S. Army, North-USARNORTH). 
z U.S. Southern Command (U.S. Army, South-USARSO). 
z U.S. Central Command (U.S. Army, Central-USARCENT). 
z U.S. European Command (U.S. Army, Europe-USAREUR). 
z U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (U.S. Army, Pacific-USARPAC). 
z U.S. Africa Command (U.S. Army, Africa-USARAF).  
In addition to these geographic combatant commands, U.S. Forces  Korea is a subordinate unified command 
of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. It also has a theater army (Eight h Army-EUSA).  
A-8. There are four functional combatan t commands. Each has global r esponsibilities. Like the geographic 
combatant commands, each has an ASCC assigned. These organizati ons are not theater armies; they are 
functional Service component commands. The functional combatant  commands and their associated ASCCs 
areâ€” 
z U.S. Cyber Command (U.S. Army Cyber Command-ARCYBER). 
z U.S. Strategic Command (U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Com mand/Army Strategic 
Command-SMDC/ARSTRAT). 
z U.S. Special Operations Command ( U.S. Army Special Operations C ommand-USASOC). 
z U.S. Transportation Command (Military Surface Deployment and Di stribution 
Command-SDDC). 
JOINT TASK FORCES AND SERVICE COMPONENTS  
A-9. JTFs are the organizations most often used by a combatant comma nder for contingencies. Combatant 
commanders establish JTFs and designate the JFCs for these comm ands. Those commanders exercise 
OPCON of all U.S. forces through functional component commands,  Service components, subordinate JTFs, 
or a combination of these. (See figure A-2 on page A-4.) The se nior Army officer assigned to a JTF, other 
than the JFC and members of the JTF, becomes the ARFOR commande r. The ARFOR commander answers 
to the Secretary of the Army through the ASCC for most ADCON re sponsibilities. 
Appendix A 
A-4 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 Figure A-2. Joint task f orce organization options 
A-10. Depending on the JTF organization, the ARFOR commander may  exercise OPCON of some or all
Army forces assigned to the task force. For example, an Army co rps headquarters may become a joint force
land component within a large JTF. (See figure A-3, which shows  an example of a JTF organized into
functional components.) The corps commander exercises OPCON of Army divisions and tactical control
(TACON) of Marine Corps forces within the land component. As th e senior Army headquarters, the corps
becomes the ARFOR for not only the Army divisions but also for all other Army units within the JTF,
including those not under OPCON of the corps. This ensures that  Service responsibilities are fulfilled while
giving the JFC maximum flexibility for employing the joint forc e. Unless modified by the Secretary of the
Army or the ASCC, Service responsibilities continue through the  ARFOR to the respective Army
commanders. Army forces in figure A-3 are shaded to show this r elationship. The corps has OPCON of the
Army divisions and TACON of the Marine division. The corps does  not have OPCON over the other Army
units but does, as the ARFOR, exercise ADCON over them. The cor ps also helps the ASCC in controlling
Army support to other Services and to any multinational forces as directed.
A-11. When an Army headquarters becomes the joint force land com ponent as part of a JTF, Army units
subordinated to it are normally under OPCON. Marine Corps force s made available to a joint force land
component command built around an Army headquarters are normall y under TACON. The land component
commander makes recommendations to the JFC on properly using at tached, OPCON, or TACON assets;
planning and coordinating land op erations; and accomplishing su ch operational missions as assigned.
A-12. Navy and Coast Guard forces  often operate under a joint fo rce maritime component commander. This
commander makes recommendations to the JFC on proper use of ass ets attached or under OPCON or
TACON. Maritime component commanders also make recommendations concerning planning and
coordinating maritime operations and accomplishing such mission s.
A-13. A joint force air component commander is normally designat ed the supported commander for the air
interdiction and counterair missions. The air component command  is typically the headquarters with the most
air assets. Like the other functional component commanders, the  air component commander makes
recommendations to the JFC on properly using assets attached or  under OPCON or TACON. The air
component commander makes recommendations for planning and coor dinating air operations and
accomplishing such missions. Additionally, the air component co mmander often has responsibility for
airspace control authorit y and area air defense.

Command and Support Relationships 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 A-5A-14. The JFC may organize special operations forces and convent ional forces together as a joint special
operations task force or a subordinate JTF. Other functional co mponents and subordinate task forces â€”such
as a joint logistic task force o r joint psychological operation s task force â€”are established as required.
Figure A-3. Example of a joint t ask force showing an Army corps  as joint force land 
component commander with ARFOR responsibilities  
JOINT COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS 
A-15. JP 1 specifies and details four types of joint command rel ationships:
zCombatant command (command authority) (COCOM).
zOPCON.
zTACON.
zSupport.
Paragraphs A-16 through A-22 summarize important provisions of these relationships. 
COMBATANT COMMAND (COMMAND AUTHORITY ) 
A-16. COCOM is the command authority over assigned forces vested  only in commanders of combatant
commands or as directed by the President or the Secretary of De fense in the Unified Command Plan and
cannot be delegated or transferred. Title 10, United States Cod e, section 164 specifies it in law. Normally,
the combatant commander exercises this authority through subord inate JFCs, Service component, and
functional component commanders. COCOM includes the directive a uthority for logistic matters (or the

Appendix A 
A-6 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 authority to delegate it to a subordinate JFC for common suppor t capabilities required to accomplish the 
subordinate â€™s mission).  
OPERATIONAL CONTROL
A-17. OPCON is the authority to perform those functions of comma nd over subordinate forces involving â€”
zOrganizing and employing commands and forces.
zAssigning tasks.
zDesignating objectives.
zGiving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish missions .
A-18. OPCON normally includes authority over all aspects of oper ations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions. It does not include directive authority fo r logistics or matters of administration,
discipline, internal organization, or unit training. The combat ant commander must specifically delegate these
elements of COCOM. OPCON does include the authority to delineate  functional responsibilities and
operational areas of subordinate JFCs. In two instances, the Se cretary of Defense may specify adjustments
to accommodate authorities beyond OPCON in an establishing dire ctive: when transferring forces between
combatant commanders or when transferring members and organizat ions from the military departments to a
combatant command. Adjustments will be coordinated with the par ticipating combatant commanders. (See
JP 1 for a detailed discussion of OPCON.)
TACTICAL CONTROL
A-19. TACON is inherent in OPCON . It may be delegated to and exe rcised by commanders at any echelon
at or below the level of combatant command. TACON provides suff icient authority for controlling and
directing the application of force or tactical use of maneuver support assets within the assigned mission or
task. TACON does not provide organizational authority or author itative direction for administrative and
logistic support; the commander of the parent unit continues to  exercise these authorities unless otherwise
specified in the establishing dir ective. (See JP 1 for a detail ed discussion of TACON.)
SUPPORT
A-20. Support is a command authority in joint doctrine. A support ed and supporting relationship is
established by a superior commander between subordinate command ers when one organization should aid,
protect, complement, or sustain another force. Designating supp orting relationships is important. It conveys
priorities to commanders and staffs planning or executing joint  operations. Designating a support relationship
does not provide authority to o rganize and employ commands and forces, nor does it include authoritative
direction for administrative and logistic support. Joint doctri ne divides support into the categories listed in
table A-1.
Command and Support Relationships 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 A-7 Table A-1. Joint support categories 
Category Definition 
General support  That support which is given to the supported force as a whole a nd not to any 
particular subdivision thereof (JP 3-09.3). 
Mutual support  That support which units render each other against an enemy, be cause of their 
assigned tasks, their position relative to each other and to th e enemy, and their 
inherent capabilities (JP 3-31). 
Direct support  A mission requiring a force to support another specific force a nd authorizing it 
to answer directly to the supported force â€™s request for assistance (JP 3-09.3). 
Close support  That action of the supporting force against targets or objectiv es that are 
sufficiently near the supported force as to require detailed in tegration or 
coordination of the supporting action (JP 3-31). 
A-21.  Support is, by design, somewhat vague but very flexible. Establ ishing authorities ensure both 
supported and supporting commanders understand the authority of  supported commanders. Joint force 
commanders often establish suppor ted and supporting relationshi ps among components. For example, the 
maritime component commander is n ormally the supported commande r for sea control operations; the air 
component commander is normally the supported commander for cou nterair operations. An Army 
headquarters designated as the land component may be the suppor ting force during some campaign phases 
and the supported force in other phases. 
A-22.  The JFC may establish a support relationship between functional  and Service component commanders. 
Conducting operations across a large operational area often inv olves both the land and air component 
commanders. The JTF commander places the land component in gene ral support of the air component until 
the latter achieves air superiority. Conversely, within the lan d area of operations, the land component 
commander becomes the supported commander and the air component  commander provides close support. 
A joint support relationship is not used when an Army commander  task-organizes Army forces in a 
supporting role. When task-organized to support another Army fo rce, Army forces use one of four Army 
support relationships. (See paragraphs A-38 through A-39.)  
JOINT ASSIGNMENT AND ATTACHMENT  
A-23.  Forces under the jurisdiction of  the secretaries of the militar y departments (with some exceptions) are 
assigned to combatant commands or the commander, U.S. Element N orth America Aerospace Defense 
Command (known as USELEMNORAD). The exception exempts those for ces necessary to carry out the 
functions of the military departments as noted in Title 10, Uni ted States Code, section 162. The assignment 
of forces to the combatant commands comes from the Secretary of  D e f e n s e  i n  t h e  F o r c e s  f o r  U n i f i e d  
Commands memorandum. According to this memorandum and the Unifi ed Command Plan, unless otherwise 
directed by the President or the Secretary of Defense, all forc es operating in the geographic area assigned to 
a combatant commander are assigned or attached to that combatan t commander. A force assigned or attached 
to a combatant command may be transferred from that command to another combatant commander only 
when directed by the Secretary of Defense and approved by the P resident. The Secretary of Defense specifies 
the command relationship the gaining commander will exercise (a nd the losing commander will relinquish). 
Establishing authorities for subordinate unified commands and J TFs may direct the assignment or attachment 
of their forces to those subordinate commands and delegate the command relationship as appropriate. (See 
JP 1 for more information on joint assignment and attachment.)  
A-24.  When the Secretary of Defense assigns Army forces to a combatan t command, the transfer is either 
permanent or the duration is unknown but very lengthy. The comb atant commander exercises COCOM over 
assigned forces. When the Secretary of Defense attaches Army un its, this indicates that the transfer of units 
is relatively temporary. Attached forces normally return to the ir parent combatant command at the end of the 
deployment. The combatant commander exercises OPCON of the atta ched force. In either case, the 
combatant commander normally exercises OPCON over Army forces t hrough the ASCC until the combatant 
commander establishes a JTF or functional component. At that ti me, the combatant commander delegates 
OPCON to the JTF commander. When the JFC establishes any comman d relationship, the ASCC clearly 
specifies ADCON responsibilities  for all affected Army commande rs. 
Appendix A 
A-8 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 COORDINATING AUTHORITY
A-25. The coordinating authority  is a commander or individual who has the authority to require consultation
between the specific functions or activities involving forces o f two or more Services, joint force components,
or forces of the same Service or  agencies, but does not have th e authority to compel agreement (JP 1). In the
event that essential agreement cannot be obtained, the matter s hall be referred to the appointing authority.
Coordinating authority is a consultation relationship, not an a uthority through which command may be
exercised. Coordinating authorit y is more applicable to plannin g and similar activities than to operations.
(See JP 1 for a detailed discussion of coordinating authority.)  For example, a joint security commander
exercises coordinating authority over area security operations within the joint security area. Commanders or
leaders at any echelon at or below combatant command may be del egated coordinating authority. These
individuals may be assigned responsibilities established throug h a memorandum of agreement between
military and nonmilitary organizations.
DIRECT LIAISON AUTHORIZED
A-26. Direct liaison authorized  is that authority granted by a commander (any level) to a subo rdinate to
directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or agen cy within or outside of the granting command
(JP 1). Direct liaison authorized is more applicable to plannin g than operations and always carries with it the
requirement of keeping the commander granting direct liaison au thorized informed. Direct liaison authorized
is a coordination relationship, not  an authority through which command may be exercised.
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL
A-27. Administrative control  is direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or othe r organizations in
respect to administration and support (JP 1). It is a Service a uthority, not a joint authority. It is exercised
under the authority of and is delegated by the Secretary of the  Army. ADCON is synonymous with the
Army â€™s Title 10 authorities and responsibilities.
A-28. The ASCC is always the senior Army headquarters assigned t o a combatant command. Its commander
exercises command authorities as assigned by the combatant comm ander and ADCON as delegated by the
Secretary of the Army. ADCON is the Army â€™s authority to administer and support Army forces even while
in a combatant command area of responsibility. COCOM is the aut hority for command and control of the
same Army forces. The Army is obligated to meet the combatant c ommander â€™s requirements for the
operational forces. Essentially, ADCON directs the Army â€™s support of operational force requirements. Unless
modified by the Secretary of the Army, administrative responsib ilities normally flow from Department of the
Army through the ASCC to those Army forces assigned or attached  to that combatant command. ASCCs
usually share ADCON for at least some administrative or support  functions. Shared ADCON refers to the
internal allocation of Title 10, United States Code, section 30 13(b) responsibilities and functions. This is
especially true for Reserve Component forces. Certain administr ative functions, such as pay, stay with the
Reserve Component headquarters, even after unit mobilization. S hared ADCON also applies to direct
reporting units of the Army that typically perform single or un ique functions. The direct reporting unit, rather
than the ASCC, typically manages individual and unit training f or these units. The Secretary of the Army
directs shared ADCON.
ARMY COMMAND AND SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS 
A-29. Army command relationships are similar but not identical t o joint command authorities and
relationships. Differences stem from the way Army forces task-o rganize internally and the need for a system
of support relationships between Army forces. Another important  difference is the requirement for Army
commanders to handle the administrative support requirements th at meet the needs of Soldiers. These
differences allow for flexible allocation of Army capabilities within various Army echelons. Army command
and support relationships are the basis for building Army task organizations. A task organization is a
temporary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a particula r mission. Certain responsibilities are
inherent in the Army â€™s command and support relationships.
Command and Support Relationships 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 A-9ARMY COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS  
A-30. Table A-2 on page A-10 lists the Army command relationships and  possible authorities that can flow 
with those relationships. Command  relationship s define superior  and subo rdinate relationsh ips between units. 
Command  relationships identify  where  the units  or billets  will reside  in time and space.  With  a command  
relationship,  separate  command  authority  is transferred  at discretion  of the designating  authority.  When  a 
chain of command is established, the command relationship unifi es the effort an d the specified authorities 
provide commanders  the ability  to employ  subordinate  forces  with maximum  flexibility.  Army  command 
relationship s identify time an d duration of assignment or attac hment and autho rity identifies  the degree of 
control  provided  to the gaining  Army  commander.  The type of command  relationship  often  relates  to the 
expected longevity of the relationship b etween the head quarters  involved, and it quickly identifies the degree 
of support that the gaining and losing Army commanders provide.
A-31.  When referring to units, organic  is assigned to and forming an essential part of a military org anization 
as listed  in its table  of organization  for the Army,  Air Force,  and Ma rine Corps, and are assigned to the 
operating forces for the Navy (JP 1). Joint command relationshi ps do not include organic because a JFC is 
not responsible for the o rganizational structure of units. Join t units are formed and not recruited for manning, 
training and equipp ing. That is  a service responsibility under Title 10 United States Code.
A-32.  The Army establishes organic command relationships through orga nizational documents such as tables 
of organization and equipment and tables of d istribution and  allowances. If temporarily task-organized with 
another headquarters, organic units return to the control of th eir organic headquarters after accomplishing the 
mission. To illustrate, within a BCT, the entire brigade is org anic. In contrast, within most modular support 
brigades,  there  is a base of organic  battalions  and companies  and a variable  mix of assigned  and attached 
battalions and companies.
A-33. Army  assigned  units  remain  subordinate  to the higher  echelon  headquarters  for extended  periods, 
typically  years.  Assignment  is based  on the needs  of the Army,  and it is formalized  by orders rather  than 
organizational documents. Although force tailorin g or task-organizing may temporarily detach units, they 
even tually  return to either their headq uarters of assig nment or th eir org anic h eadq uarters. Attached u nits are 
temp orarily subordinated to the gainin g headquarters, and the period may be lengthy, often months or 
longer.
A-34.  Attached  units  return  to their parent headquarters  (assigned  or organic)  when  the reason  for the 
attachment ends. The Army headquarters that receives another Ar my unit through assignment or attachment 
assumes  responsibility  for the ADCON  requirements,  and particul arly sustainment,  that normally  extend 
down  to that echelon,  unless  modified by directives  or orders.  For example,  when  an Army  division 
commander attaches an en gineer battalion to a BCT, the brigade commander assumes responsibility for the 
unit training, maintenance,  resupply, and unit-level reporting for that battalion.
Appendix A 
A-10 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 Table A-2. Command relationships 
A-35. Army commanders normally place a unit OPCON or TACON to a gaining headquarters for a given
mission, lasting perhaps a few days. OPCON lets the gaining com mander task-organize and direct forces.
TACON does not let the gaining commander task-organize the unit . Hence, TACON is the command
relationship often used between Army, other Service, and multin ational forces within a task organization, but
rarely between Army forces. Neither OPCON nor TACON affects ADC ON responsibilities. To modify the
example used in paragraph A-34, i f the Army division commander placed the engineer battalion OPCON to
the BCT, the gaining brigade commander would not be responsible  for the unit training, maintenance,
resupply, and unit-level reporting of the engineers. Those resp onsibilities would remain with the parent

Command and Support Relationships 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 A-11 ARMY SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS  
A-37.  Table A-3 lists Army support relationships. Army support relati onships are not a command authority, 
and they are more specific than the joint support relationships . Commanders establish support relationships 
when subordination of one unit to another is inappropriate. The y assign a support relationship when â€” 
z The support is more effective if a commander with the requisite  technical and tactical expertise 
controls the supporting unit, r ather than the supported command er. 
z The echelon of the supporting unit is the same as or higher tha n that of the supported unit. For 
example, the supporting unit may be a brigade, and the supporte d unit may be a battalion. It would 
be inappropriate for the brigade to be subordinated to the batt alion, hence the use of an Army 
support relationship. 
z The supporting unit supports sever al units simultaneously. The requirement to set support 
priorities to allocate resources to supported units exists. Ass igning support relationships is one 
aspect of command and control.

Note: 1 Commanders of units in direct support may further assign suppor t relationships between their subordinate units 
and elements of the supported unit after coordination with the supported commander. 
A-38.  Army support relationships allow supporting commanders to emplo y their units â€™ capabilities to achieve 
results required by supported commanders. Support relationships  are graduated from an exclusive supported 
and supporting relationship between two units â€”as in direct support â€”to a broad level of support extended to 
all units under the control of the higher headquarters-as in ge neral support. Support relationships do not alter 
ADCON. Commanders specify and change support relationships thro ugh task-organizing. 
OTHER RELATIONSHIPS  
A-39.  Several other relationships established by higher echelon headq uarters exist with units that are not in 
command or support relationships. (See table A-4 on page A-12.)  These relationships are limited or 
Appendix A 
A-12 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 specialized to a greater degree than the command and support re lationships. These limited relationships are 
not used when tailoring or task-organizing Army forces. Use of these specialized relationships helps clarify 
certain aspects of OPCON or ADCON.

A-40. Training and readiness oversight  is the authority that combatant commanders may exercise over
assigned Reserve Component forces when not on active duty or wh en on active duty for training (JP 1).
Responsibilities for both training and readiness are inherent i n ADCON, and they are exercised by unit
commanders for their units. Army National Guard forces are orga nized by the Department of the Army under
their respective states. These forces remain under command of t he governor of that state until mobilized for
Federal service. U.S. Army Reserve forces are assigned to U.S. Army Reserve Command. For Army National
Guard units, combatant commanders normally exercise training an d readiness oversight through their ASCC;
for most, this is U.S. Army Forces Command. The ASCC coordinate s with the appropriate State Adjutants
General and Army National Guard divisions to refine mission-ess ential task lists for Army National Guard
units. The ASCC coordinates mission-essential task lists for Ar my Reserve units with the U.S. Army Reserve
Command and Support Relationships 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 A-13Command. When Reserve Component units align with an expeditiona ry force package during Army force 
generation, U.S. Army Forces Command establishes coordinating r elationships as required between Regular 
Army and Reserve Component units. When mobilized, Reserve Compo nent units are assigned or attached to 
their gaining headquarters. Most operating forces ADCON respons ibilities, including unit training and 
readiness, shift to the gaining headquarters.  
A-41. Army force packages for combatant commanders combine force s from many different parent
organizations. The Army assigns or attaches Regular Army forces  to various Army headquarters based on
factors such as stationing, unit history, and habitual associat ion of units in training. Different Army
headquarters may share ADCON to  optimize administration and sup port. For example, U.S. Army Forces
Command may attach a BCT to a division headquarters located on a different installation. That division
commander has training and readiness responsibilities for the B CT but does not control the training resources
located at the BCT â€™s installation. The senior Army commander on the BCT â€™s installation manages training
resources such as ranges and simulation centers. At the directi on of the Secretary of the Army, the
commanders share ADCON responsibilities. If the division headqu arters deploys on an extended mission and
the BCT remains, training and readiness responsibilities for th e BCT shift to another commander.
Headquarters, Department of the Army or another appropriate Arm y authority redistributes ADCON
responsibilities for the BCT to a new headquarters. When the BC T deploys to a geographic combatant
command, ADCON passes to the gaining theater army unless modifi ed by the Secretary of the Army. (See
FM 7-0 for a detailed discussion of training responsibilities.)
A-42. Alignment is an informal relationship between a theater ar my and other Army units identified for use
in the area of responsibility of a geographic combatant command . Alignment helps focus unit exercises and
other training on a particular r egion. This may lead to establi shment of direct liaison authorized between the
aligned unit and a different ASCC. Any modular Army force may f ind itself included in an expeditionary
force package heading to a different combatant command. Therefo re, Army commanders maintain a balance
between regional focus and global capability.
ARFOR 
A-43.  The ARFOR is the Army component of any joint force. Army doctrine distinguishes, however,
between the Army component of a combatant command and that of a  joint force formed by the combatant
commander. The Army component of the combatant command is an AS CC, and the Army component of the
subordinate joint force is an AR FOR. (See JP 1 and JP 3-0 for m ore information on the ARFOR.)
THE ARFOR  IN A SUBORDINATE JOINT FORCE
A-44.  All JTFs that include Army forces have an ARFOR. The ARFO R consists of the Army commander,
the commander â€™s associated headquarters, and all Army forces attached to the JTF. The ARFOR provides
administrative and logistics support to all Army forces and ret ains OPCON over Army units not subordinate
to another component of the JTF. The senior Army officer assign ed to the JTF, not in a joint duty assignment,
becomes the ARFOR commander. Since the preferred joint approach  for a JTF headquarters uses an existing
Service headquarters, the JTF co mmander and headquarters retain s all responsibilities associated with both
command positions (ARFOR and JTF). This can overload the JTF he adquarters unless the commander
delegates authority for Service-specific matters to another com mander. For example, when a corps becomes
a  J T F  h e a d q u a r t e r s ,  t h e  c o r p s  c o m m a n d e r  b e c o m e s  t h e  J T F  c o m m a n d er. The corps retains ARFOR
responsibilities through the ASCC back to the Army, unless the corps commander shifts Service
responsibilities to another headq uarters. The corps commander n ormally designates a subordinate Army
commander and staff as the deputy ARFOR commander for performin g those duties. (See JP 1 and JP 3-33
for more information on the ARFOR in a subordinate joint force. )
A-45.  The typical JTF has a combination of Service and function al components. While the JTF will always
have an ARFOR if it commands Army units, the operational roles of the ARFOR can vary. It is important to
understand that the ARFOR exercises both OPCON and ADCON over A rmy forces in the JTF. However,
not all Army forces are necessarily OPCON to the ARFOR. The ARF OR commander retains OPCON over
Army forces attached to the joint  force until the JFC places se lected Army units under the command of
another component in the JTF. The JFC may designate the senior Army commander and headquarters as the
joint force land component command, in which case the Army comm ander exercises OPCON or TACON
Appendix A 
A-14 ADP 3-0 31 July 2019 over other Service forces, in addition to OPCON and ADCON over Army forces. In this case, dual command 
responsibilities as ARFOR and joint force land component are ma nageable, since the preponderance of forces 
are Army, and the missions assigned to other land forces are si milar. 
A-46. The combatant commander detaches Army forces from the thea ter army and attaches them to a JTF
(or another joint force, such as a subunified command). This re moves them from the OPCON of the theater
army and places them under the OPCON of the gaining JFC. When c ommand transfers to the gaining JTF,
the ARFOR in the JTF exercises OPCON over Army forces attached to the JTF until the JFC directs
otherwise. The JTF commander organizes the joint force by speci fying command relationships (OPCON,
TACON, or support) between attached forces. The ARFOR commander  retains OPCON over those Army
forces not subordinate to another  component commander, such as a joint special operations component. The
ARFOR commander is responsible for all aspects of planning and executing operations as directed by the
JFC.
A-47. In addition to controlling Army forces, the ARFOR coordina tes Army support to other Services
(ASOS). ASOS includes provision of common-user logistics and ex ecutive agent support to the JTF as
required by the JTF establishing authority. To make this coordi nation more manageable, the theater army
normally retains command of logistics and medical support units  that are not part of the brigades. These units
provide area support not only to the Army forces but also to th e joint force. The ARFOR headquarters
manages support to other Services including, but not limited to â€”
zMissile defense.
zFire support.
zBase defense.
zTransportation.
zFuel distribution.
zGeneral engineering.
zIntratheater medical evacuation.
zVeterinary services.
zLogistics management.
zCommunications.
zChemical, biological,  radiological, and  nuclear defense.
zConsequence management capability.
zExplosive ordnance disposal.
A-48. As required by the theater army, the ARFOR commander exerc ises ADCON over all Army forces in
the JTF, including those subordinate to other components. Depen ding on the JTF organization, the ARFOR
commander may exercise OPCON of some or all Army forces assigne d to the task force, and the ARFOR
commander remains responsible for ADCON of those forces. Howeve r, the exercise of OPCON is a
delegation of joint command authority and not a function of ADC ON.
A-49. The theater army commander will specify the ADCON responsi bilities of the ARFOR, with the theater
army normally retaining control of reception, staging, onward m ovement, and integration; logistics support
of the deployed force; personnel support; and medical support. Administrative responsibilities normally
retained by the ARFOR include internal administration and disci pline, training within the joint operations
area, and Service-specific reporting. The theater army normally  retains OPCON of Army sustainment and
medical commands operating in the joint operations area. The th eater army commander establishes an Army
support relationship between the ARFOR and these units.
ARFOR R ESPONSIBILITIES
A-50. A division, corps, or field army headquarters serving as t he ARFOR for a JTF includes the headquarters
controlling multiple subordinate tactical formations and the Ar my forces placed under a joint or multinational
headquarters. The Army commander i s responsible to the JFC for these operational requirements. However,
the JFC is not responsible for Service-specific matters involvi ng administration and support of Army forces.
The Army forces commander answers to the Secretary of the Army through the ASCC for Service-specific
matters, whether it is a theater army or functional command (fo r example, the Surface Deployment and
Command and Support Relationships 
31 July 2019 ADP 3-0 A-15Distribution Command of the United States Transportation Comman d). A theater army provides ADCON or 
Title 10 authorities and responsibilities for all Army units wi thin the JTF, including those not under OPCON 
of the headquarters. In certain circumstances, such as geograph ic separation between the ADCON 
headquarters and the intermed iate tactical headquarters, the th eater army commander can delegate authority 
to execute specified administrative tasks to Army component com manders under OPCON of JFCs operating 
in joint operations areas w ithin an area of operations. 
A-51. The ARFOR within a joint operations area
normally exercises OPCON over all Armymaneuver, fires, and maneuver support forces (such
as military police; air and missile defense; engineer;
civil affairs; and chemical,  biological, radiological,
and nuclear), except for Army forces providingsustainment (including medical support). TheARFOR in a joint operations area identifiesrequirements, establishes priorities of support for
Army forces, and coordinates with the theater army
for providing sustainment. The ASCC may itself
function as an ARFOR unless the combatantcommander exercises command and control throughsubordinate JFCs. In this case, each subordinate JFCpotentially has subordinate Army forces, while the
ASCC exercises ADCON of all Army forces across
the area of responsibility. The ASCC providesASOS, common-user logistics, assignmenteligibility and availability, and sustainment tointeragency elements and Army, joint, and
multinational forces in a joint operations area.
A-52. This relationship relieves division or corps
headquarters (as ARFOR within the joint operations area) of res ponsibility for directly exercising ADCON
and sustaining tasks for Army forces and providing ASOS, common -user logistics, and Army executive agent
responsibilities. The sustainment concept splits the responsibi lities between the ARFOR in the joint
operations area or the joint force command (division or corps) and the theater army. The theater army
provides sustainment to all Army forces stationed in, transitin g through, or operating within the area of
operations. It also provides most ASOS, common-user logistics, and Army executive agent support to unified
action partners within the area of operations. The theater army  executes these sustainment responsibilities
through its assigned theater sustainment command with expeditio nary sustainment commands and tailored
sustainment brigades provided from the Army pool of Service-ret ained rotational forces. The theater army
provides medical services to support the force through its assi gned medical command (deployment support)
and forward deployed medical brigades. (See FM 4-02 for more in formation on medical support.)
A-53. For each of the combatant commands, the Secretary of Defen se has assigned administrative and
logistics support for subordinate joint elements to one of the four military services. The Department of the
Army delegates its assigned Combatant Command Support Agent (CC SA) responsibilities to the respective
theater army (or in the case of Korea, to the Eighth Army) for that geographic combatant command. U.S.
Army South performs CCSA for USSOUTHCOM and SOCSOUTH. U.S. Army  Europe performs CCSA for
USEUCOM, U.S. Special Operations Command Europe, U.S. Army Afri ca performs CCSA for
USAFRICOM, and U.S. Special Operations Command Africa. Eighth A rmy performs CCSA for U.S. Joint
Forces Korea and U.S. Special Op erations Command Korea. USASOC performs CCSA for Joint Special
Operations Command. (See DODD 5100.03 for more information on c ombatant commands.)
REGULATORY AUTHORITIES
A-54. Regulations, policies, and other authoritative sources als o direct and guide Army forces, Army
commands, direct reporting units , ASCCs, and other Army element s. The Army identifies technical matters,
such as network operations or contracting, and assigns responsi bilities for them to an appropriate
organization. These organizations use technical channels establ ished by regulation, policy, or directive.Army Executive Agent Responsibilities
Under the authority of the Secretary of Defense 
and Title 10, U.S. Code, the Army has been 
designated the executive agent by the Secretary 
of Defense or Deputy Secretary of Defense for 
foundational activities that are not necessarily landpower equities, but functions necessary to the entire joint force. These functions include, but 
are not limited to
â€”

A-55. The primary regulation governing the missions, functions, and command and staff relationships,
including ADCON, of the subordinate elements of the Department of the Army is AR 10-87. This regulation
prescribes the relationships and responsibilities among Army fo rces, Army commands, direct reporting units,
and ASCCs. It includes channels for technical supervision, advi ce, and support for specific functions among
various headquarters, agencies, and units. Other regulations an d policies specify responsibilities in
accordance with DOD directives and U.S. statutes.
